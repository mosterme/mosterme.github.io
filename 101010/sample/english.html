Guidance from the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/v3/en/c6-digital-identity.html">OWASP Proactive Controls: C6</a></em></p>
<p>One of the toughest problems is figuring out who&#8217;s who online.</p>
<p><img class="width-fit aligncenter wp-image-65643 size-large" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-6.png?w=354&#038;resize=354%2C476" alt="" width="354" height="476" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-6.png?w=354&#038;resize=354%2C476 354w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-6.png?w=223 223w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Identity management is tricky, and improperly verifying identity can have <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/04/panerabread-com-leaks-millions-of-customer-records/">massive</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cryptojacking-tesla-amazon-cloud/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1650565608337955&amp;usg=AOvVaw2O-UGNPQ0JaZ9j3YJ9DxvA">security</a> implications.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re here to help offer some guidance about how to securely implement authentication (that is, how to verify digital identity) into your app. In the blog post below, we‚Äôll discuss ways that will help you securely implement these features into your application.</p>
<p>OWASP breaks down the three main approaches to managing digital identity into the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Passwords</li>
<li aria-level="1">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Cryptographic-based authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>Given the current authentication landscape, we‚Äôre adding another category:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Single sign-on (SSO)</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll discuss single sign-on first, as it can be the simplest form of authentication to implement into your application.</p>
<h2>Using single sign-on (SSO)</h2>
<p>The simplest way to assert whether a user is who they say they are is to have a trusted third party confirm their identity. Technically speaking, this means having your users sign into a platform with a robust authentication platform (like, GitHub, Google, or Apple), then having that platform tell your application &#8220;this user is &lt;some user&gt;.&#8221;</p>
<p>By using SSO, neither you nor your users need to deal with having an additional password. You also don&#8217;t need to deal with any of the infrastructure needed to verify a user&#8217;s digital identity. Instead, this is the responsibility of a service provider.</p>
<p>The main tradeoff with using SSO is that you need to trust the identity provider. However, generally speaking, identity providers tend to have robust security resources dedicated to protecting user authentication. As such, in most cases we&#8217;d advise you to consider using an authentication provider as opposed to writing your own authentication.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of ways to implement this into your application. The most common way for a web application is to use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">OAuth</a> or <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-saml/">SAML</a>. Check out <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps">our documentation</a> for more information about how to use GitHub for OAuth!</p>
<p>Next, let&#8217;s discuss the oldest and most common way of handling authentication‚Äîpasswords.</p>
<h2>Handling passwords</h2>
<p>When handling user accounts and identities, the first thing that usually comes to mind is passwords. Passwords are the way most users are accustomed to creating a new account, and rely on a user generating a secret string, which they present to the application each time they want to be authenticated.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a couple of key issues to look out for when using passwords in your application as follows:</p>
<h3>1. Creating (and facilitating the creation of) secure passwords</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="740" height="601" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65641 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/password_strength.png?w=300&#038;resize=740%2C601" alt="&quot;" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/password_strength.png?w=740 740w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/password_strength.png?w=300&#038;resize=740%2C601 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Easily guessable passwords can lead to account compromises, so you need to ensure that your users are setting strong credentials.</p>
<h4><strong>Provide guardrails to ensure users set strong passwords, without requirements that upset or confuse them.</strong></h4>
<p>It‚Äôs important to strike a proper balance between a positive user experience and good security! Studies have shown that complexity requirements on passwords have mixed effectiveness, so you‚Äôre better off removing abstract character requirements<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/"> in favor of longer passwords</a>.</p>
<p>OWASP‚Äôs guidance for good password guardrails are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Ensure all passwords are at least 10 characters in length.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Allow all printable ASCII characters.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords">commonly-used</a> and <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords">compromised passwords</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Allowing user-friendly, longer passwords means that your users will be happier, more likely to remember them, and less vulnerable to a brute force attack.</p>
<p>This is a good place to mention that you should not prevent paste in password fields. This is extremely user unfriendly, and makes it harder for users to use tooling, like password managers, incentivizing bad passwords.</p>
<p>Remember, user friendly comes first!</p>
<h3>2. Recovering passwords</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve all forgotten our passwords at some point. Without them, how can we securely assert our identity? We can do this by using an alternate method, like multi-factor authentication!</p>
<h4><strong>Verify your user‚Äôs identity using multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong></h4>
<p>We&#8217;ll discuss MFA in more depth later, but in a nutshell, in a secure MFA implementation, you should have a user prove their identity by using a combination of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Have them use something they know.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">For example, have them answer a security question.</li>
<li aria-level="2">For further guidance, specifically about security questions, check out the<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet"> OWASP forgotten password cheat sheets</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Have them use something they own.
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">For example, send a reset token to a device or other account that they own (email).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure to provide a user friendly flow to reset their password using some combination of the above methods.</p>
<p>Another good idea is to provide some instructions in your password recovery flow if the user did not expect to receive a password recovery email (for example, please change your password immediately).</p>
<h3>3. Storing passwords securely</h3>
<p>Passwords are the most critical part of a user asserting their identity. As such, we need to treat them carefully in our infrastructure. Especially with password dumps seemingly becoming more common every day, it‚Äôs extremely important to keep in mind the following.</p>
<h4>Never store passwords in plain text</h4>
<p>Storing passwords in plain text means that any user that gets access to your password database will be able to login as any other user. In the event of a breach, this would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>On the other hand, only handling properly-hashed passwords ensures that a malicious user that does get access to the password database will need to spend an enormous amount of time trying to brute force each password.</p>
<p>In order to properly implement this, keep in mind two things:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Choose the right hashing algorithm.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Cryptography is tough! So, it&#8217;s important to use an algorithm/library that has been vetted by security experts and is well used.</li>
<li aria-level="2">A good hashing algorithm should be slow from both a CPU and GPU perspective (to prevent brute forcing a password).</li>
<li aria-level="2">We&#8217;d recommend using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> or Bcrypt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Salt your passwords.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Attackers have access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables,</a> which are massive databases of precomputed hash to string pairs. This can be used to map hashed versions of passwords back to their strings (for commonly-used strings). In order to add entropy to the hashes and thus make it less likely that the rainbow table contains the mapping, you should add a random string, known as a salt, to user passwords when hashing. See <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/">the following blog post</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Handling brute force attacks</h3>
<p>Given an infinite number of guesses, any password can technically be guessed. To reduce the probability of a successful password being tried, implement rate limiting or lockout protections for a certain number of failed attempts. Dial this according to existing policies and sensitivity of the data you are protecting.</p>
<p>For example, you could set up a counter to only allow five failed login attempts in an hour. Then, lock the account, and let the user know of the failed attempts via email.</p>
<p>To implement this, it&#8217;s important to track the number of failed logins for any given resource. You can use Redis, or another similar tool, to implement rate limiting.</p>
<p>This also helps prevent credential stuffing attacks, where leaked credentials from another site are tried against several other websites.</p>
<p>Also consider adding monitoring services to reactively inform you when a resource is being attacked! Time is everything in security, so having automated monitoring can be the difference between a successful attack and one that is thwarted.</p>
<p>Even the best password can sometimes be compromised. Next, we&#8217;ll talk about ways to protect your users beyond the use of passwords.</p>
<h2>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h2>
<p>What happens if your users have their passwords compromised? Not all is lost, as long as they have MFA enabled!</p>
<p>MFA means that users have to produce multiple pieces of information (factors) in order to be granted access to your app. This also means that an attacker would need more than just a password to take control of a user&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, MFA consists of either something a user knows, or something that a user owns. As such, there&#8217;s a variety of methods that you can use to implement this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to only support secure methods. These include <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp">TOTP</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> or push-based notifications.</p>
<p>Make sure not to support insecure methods, such as texting a user with a token. Texting a user is vulnerable to several kinds of attacks, such as spoofing, phishing, and SIM swapping. As such, keep things safe and easy for your user by only allowing one of the above options.</p>
<p>As an example of how important this is to protecting your users, <a href="https://github.blog/2022-05-04-software-security-starts-with-the-developer-securing-developer-accounts-with-2fa/">GitHub recently announced</a> that we will require all users that contribute code on GitHub.com to enable one or more methods of two-factor authentication (2FA) on their accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s take a look at how to securely handle your user&#8217;s identity using cryptographic-based authentication.</p>
<h2>Cryptographic-based authentication</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve created the proper guardrails, and your users are behaving securely, the last pillar of securing your user&#8217;s identity is to ensure that your application is properly handling your user&#8217;s identity with cryptographic-based authentication. This can happen in two main ways:</p>
<h3>Session authentication</h3>
<p>A &#8220;session&#8221; is a server side object that stores information about who the current user is, when they logged in, and other aspects of their identity. Then, in order to identify the user, we typically put a cookie on the user&#8217;s browser that contains a session identifier, which maps back to the server side identity object.</p>
<p>Some things to ensure when implementing session authentication are:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Make sure to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#security">use secure configuration settings</a> for the session cookie.
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">In most cases, you should set the `http-only`, `secure`, and `samesite=lax` flags.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ensure that the session identifier is long, unique, and random.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Generate a new session each time the user re-authenticates.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Token authentication</h3>
<p>Tokens are an alternative form of authentication, where instead of storing anything on the server side, we cryptographically sign a piece of data and give it to the client. Then, the client can give us this signed piece of data, and we can thus ensure that we successfully authenticated them.</p>
<p>Token authentication can be tricky to implement safely, so we&#8217;d recommend doing more research before implementing this yourself. However, some pointers to start, include:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Use a long, random secret key.</strong>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The entire security posture of your application relies on your tokens being generated from a secure key.</li>
<li aria-level="2">Having a weak secret key will leave you vulnerable to a brute force attack, where an attacker can try to guess your secret key, and thus hack all users at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Use a secure cryptographic algorithm, like ES256.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Set an appropriate expiration date with your tokens, based on your application&#8217;s usage patterns.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Store your tokens in a secure place.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">For a mobile app, you can use KeyStore (for Android) or KeyChain (for iOS).</li>
<li aria-level="2">For a web app, there are several places where you can store the token, each with different security considerations. For general guidance, we would recommend <strong>storing tokens in a cookie, with the `http-only`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Lax`</strong> being set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned previously, using token authentication in a web app can be tricky, and best practices differ from framework to framework, so please do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zD11ubPsFM">further research</a> before implementing this yourself.</p>
<p>Securely verifying your user&#8217;s identity can be tricky, but following the guidance above can help prevent common issues to keep your application and your users secure. Until next time, stay secure!</p>

               <article><p>At GitHub, we <a href="https://ben.balter.com/2015/08/12/the-zen-of-github/">believe it&#8217;s not fully shipped until it&#8217;s fast</a>. JavaScript makes a big impact on how pages perform. One way we work to improve JavaScript performance is to make changes to the native syntax and polyfills we ship. For example, in January of this year, we updated our compiler to output native ES2019 code, shipping native syntax for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch#the_exception_identifier">optional catch binding</a><a href="https://ben.balter.com/2015/08/12/the-zen-of-github/">.</a></p>
<p>JavaScript doesn&#8217;t get executed on very old browsers when native syntax for new language features is encountered. However, thanks to GitHub being built following the principle of progressive enhancement, users of older browsers still get to interact with basic features of GitHub, while users with more capable browsers get a faster experience.</p>
<p>GitHub will soon be serving JavaScript using syntax features found in the ECMAScript 2020 standard, which includes the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">optional chaining</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator">nullish coalescing</a> operators. This change will lead to a 10kb reduction in JavaScript across the site.</p>
<p>We want to take this opportunity to go into detail about how we think about browser support. We will share data about our customers&#8217; browser usage patterns and introduce you to some of the tools we use to make sure our customers are getting the best experience, including our recently open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/github/browser-support">browser support library</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-browsers-do-our-customers-use-">What browsers do our customers use?</h2>
<p dir="auto">To monitor the performance of pages, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#usage-information">we collect some usage information</a>. We parse <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent" rel="nofollow"><code>User-Agent</code></a> headers as part of our analytics, which lets us make informed decisions based on the browsers our users are running. Some of these decisions include, what browsers we execute automated tests on, the configuration of our static analysis tools, and even what features we ship. Around 95% of requests to our web services come from browsers with an identifying user agent string. Another 1% of requests have no User-Agent header, and the remaining 4% make up scripts, like Python (2%) or programs like cURL (0.5%).</p>
<p dir="auto">We <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/using-github/supported-browsers">encourage users to use the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari</a>, and our data shows that a majority of users do so.

<p>The above graph shows two dimensions: market share across browser vendors, and market share across versions. Looking at traffic with a branded user-agent string shows that roughly 95% of requests are coming from one of seven browsers. It also shows us that‚Äîperhaps unsurprisingly‚Äîthe majority of requests come from Google Chrome (more than 70%), 12% from Firefox, 7% from Edge, 4.2% from Safari, and 1.4% from Opera (all other browser vendors represent significantly less than 1% of traffic).</p>
<p>The fall-off for outdated versions of browsers is very steep. While over 70% of requests come from the latest release of a browser, 18% come from the previous release. Requests coming from three versions behind the latest fall to less than 1%. These numbers tell us that we can make the most impact by concentrating on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, in that order. That&#8217;s not the whole story, though.

While we see older versions used quite heavily, we also see regular upgrade cadence from Safari users, especially 15.x releases, with peak-to-peak usage approximately every eight weeks.</p>

<p dir="auto">Chrome, Edge, and Firefox all have similar release cycles with releases every four weeks. Graphing Chrome traffic by version from January through April shows us how quickly older versions of these evergreen browsers fall off. We see peak-to-peak traffic around every four weeks, with a two week period where a single version represents more than 80% of all traffic for that browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">This shows us that the promise of evergreen browsers is here today. The days of targeting one specific version of one browser are long gone. In fact, trying to do so today would be untenable. The Web Systems Team at GitHub removed the last traces of conditionals based on the user agent header in January 2020, and recorded an internal <a href="https://adr.github.io/" rel="nofollow">ADR</a> explicitly disallowing this pattern due to how hard it is to maintain code that relies on user agent header parsing.</p>
<p dir="auto">With that said, we still need to ensure <em>some</em> compatibility for user agents, which do not fall into the neat box of evergreen browsers. Universal access is important, and 1% of 73 million users is still 730,000 users.</p>
<h3 id="older-browsers">Older browsers</h3>
<p dir="auto">When looking at the remaining 4% of browser traffic, we not only see very old versions of the most popular browsers, but also a diverse array of other branded user agents. Alongside older versions of Chrome (80-89 make up 1%, and 70-79 make up 0.2%), there are also Chromium forks, like QQ Browser (0.085%), Naver Whale (0.065%), and Silk (0.003%). Alongside older versions of Firefox (80-89 make up 0.12%, and 70-79 at 0.09%) there are Firefox forks, like IceWeasel (0.0002%) and SeaMonkey (0.0004%). The data also contains lots of esoteric user agents too, such as those from TVs, e-readers, and even refrigerators. In total, we&#8217;ve seen close to 20 million unique user agent strings visiting GitHub in 2022 alone.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another vector we look at is logged-in vs. logged-out usage. As a whole, around 20% of the visits to GitHub come from browsers with logged-out sessions, but when looking at older browsers, the proportion of logged-out visits is much higher. For example, requests coming from Amazon Silk make up around 0.003% of all visits, but 80% of <em>those</em> visits are with logged-out sessions. Meaning, the number of <em>logged-in</em> visits on Silk is closer to 0.0006%. Users making requests with forked browsers also tend to make requests from evergreen browsers. For example, users making requests with SeaMonkey do so for 37% of their usage, while the other 63% come from Chrome or Firefox user agents.</p>
<p dir="auto">We consider logged-in vs. logged-out, and main vs. a secondary browser to be important distinctions, because the usage patterns are quite different. Actions that a logged-out user takes (reading issues and pull requests, cloning repositories, and browsing files) are quite different to the actions a logged-in user takes (replying to issues and reviewing pull requests, starring repositories, editing files, and looking at their dashboard). Logged-out activities tend to be more &#8220;read only&#8221; actions, which means they hit very few paths that require JavaScript to run. Whereas logged-in users tend to perform the kind of rich interactions that require JavaScript.</p>
<p dir="auto">With JavaScript disabled, you&#8217;re still able to log in, comment on issues and pull requests (although our rich markdown toolbar won&#8217;t work), browse source code (with syntax highlighting), search for repositories, and even star, watch, or fork them. Popover menus even work, thanks to the clever use of <a href="https://github.com/github/details-menu-element">the HTML <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65150 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/watch-repository-no-js-1.png?resize=427%2C382" alt="an example of the repository Watch menu working with JavaScript disabled" width="427" height="382" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/watch-repository-no-js-1.png?resize=427%2C382?w=427 427w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/watch-repository-no-js-1.png?resize=427%2C382?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2 id="how-we-engineer-for-older-browsers">How we engineer for older browsers</h2>
<p dir="auto">With such a multitude of browsers, with various levels of standards compliance, we cannot expect our engineers to know the intricacies of each. We also don&#8217;t have the resources to test on the hundreds of browsers across thousands of operating system and version combinations we see, while 0.0002% of you are using your Tesla to merge pull requests, a Model 3 won&#8217;t fit into our testing budget! <img loading="lazy" class="emoji" src="https://i0.wp.com/github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png?resize=20%2C20&#038;ssl=1" alt="wink" width="20" height="20" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, we use a few industry standard practices, like linting and polyfills, to make sure we&#8217;re delivering a good baseline experience:</p>
<h4 id="static-code-analysis-linting-to-catch-browser-compatibility-issues-">Static code analysis (linting) to catch browser compatibility issues:</h4>
<p>We love <a href="https://eslint.org/" rel="nofollow">ESLint</a>. It&#8217;s great at catching classes of bugs, as well as enforcing style, for which we have extensive configurations, but it can also be useful for catching cross-browser bugs. We use <a href="https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat">amilajack/eslint-plugin-compat</a> for guarding against use of features that aren&#8217;t well supported, and we&#8217;re not prepared to polyfill (for example, <code>ResizeObserver</code>). We also use <a href="https://github.com/keithamus/eslint-plugin-escompat">keithamus/eslint-plugin-escompat</a> for catching use of syntax that browsers do not support, and we don&#8217;t polyfill or transpile. These plugins are incredibly useful for catching quirks, for <a href="https://github.com/keithamus/eslint-plugin-escompat/blob/master/docs/no-edge-destructure-bug.md">example, older versions of Edge supported destructuring, but <em>in some instances</em> these caused a SyntaxError</a>. By linting for this corner case, we were able to ship native destructuring syntax to all browsers with a lint check to prevent engineers from hitting SyntaxErrors. Shipping native destructuring syntax allowed us to remove multiple kilobytes of transpiled code and helper functions, while linting kept code stable for older versions of Edge.</p>
<h4 id="polyfills-to-patch-browsers-with-modern-features">Polyfills to patch browsers with modern features</h4>
<p dir="auto">Past iterations of our codebase made liberal use of polyfills, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-polyfills" rel="nofollow">mdn-polyfills</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise" rel="nofollow">es6-promise</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/template-polyfill" rel="nofollow">template-polyfill</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-event-polyfill" rel="nofollow">custom-event-polyfill</a>, to name a few. Managing polyfills was burdensome and in some cases hurt performance. We were restricted in certain ways. For example, we postponed adoption of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM" rel="nofollow">ShadowDOM</a> due to the poor performance of polyfills available at the time.</p>
<p dir="auto">More recently, our strategy has been to maintain a small list of polyfills for code features that are easy enough to polyfill with low impact. These polyfills are open sourced in our <a href="https://github.com/github/browser-support">browser-support</a> repository. In this repositorty, we also maintain a function that checks if a browser has a base set of functionality necessary to run GitHub&#8217;s JavaScript. This check expects variables, like <code>Blob</code>, <code>globalThis</code>, and <code>MutationObserver</code> to exist. If a browser doesn&#8217;t pass this check, JavaScript still executes, but any uncaught exceptions will not be reported to our error reporting library that we call <code>failbot</code>. By preventing browsers that don&#8217;t meet our minimum requirements, we reduce the amount of noise in our error reporting systems, which increases the value of error reporting software dramatically. Here&#8217;s some relevant code from <code>failbot.ts</code>:</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Shipping changes and validating data</h2>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to making a change, like shipping native optional chaining syntax, one tool we reach for is an internal CLI that lets us quickly generate Markdown tables that can be added to pull requests introducing new native syntax or features that require polyfilling. This internal CLI tool uses <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">mdn/browser-compat-data</a> and combines it with the data we have to generate a <a href="https://caniuse.com/" rel="nofollow">Can I Use</a>-style feature table, but tailored to our usage data and the requested feature. For example:</p>

               <article><p>Dependabot updates are now generally available in <a href="https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/release-notes#dependabot-updates-are-generally-available">GitHub Enterprise Server 3.5</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f389.png" alt="üéâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />! Dependabot alerts have been available on GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) for years, but support for Dependabot updates‚Äì‚Äì<a href="https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/">the ability to update dependencies automatically by opening pull requests</a>‚Äì‚Äìhave been a long-standing feature request from GHES customers.</p>
<h2>How to enable Dependabot on your GitHub Enterprise Server instance</h2>
<p>As a quick refresher, Dependabot consists of three services:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Dependabot alerts:</strong> alerts you the moment vulnerabilities in your dependencies are detected</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Dependabot security updates:</strong> upgrades a dependency to the next non-vulnerable version when an exposure is detected by opening a pull request to your repository</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Dependabot version updates:</strong> opens pull requests to keep all your dependencies up to date, decreasing your exposure to vulnerabilities and your likelihood of getting stuck on an outdated version</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we‚Äôll walk through the steps for enabling Dependabot on your enterprise server, and more detailed reference material can be found in GitHub Docs:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To enable Dependabot to update your dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Have an instance of GitHub Enterprise Server running 3.5 or higher.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Note: Though Dependabot updates are available on 3.3 and 3.4, 3.5 is the lowest recommended version for general availability support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server">Enable GitHub Actions on your GitHub Enterprise Server</a>.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Note: GitHub Actions is not supported on cluster configurations at this time, so Dependabot is not supported on clustered environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">Set up one or more Linux virtual machines for the self-hosted Actions runners. These runners will be responsible for running the logic behind Dependabot.
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">Install Docker on your runner virtual machines.</li>
<li aria-level="2">See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/managing-self-hosted-runners-for-dependabot-updates#system-requirements-for-dependabot-runners">Managing self-hosted runners for Dependabot updates on your enterprise</a> in our developer documentation for more detailed instructions.</li>

<li aria-level="2">Note: Customers on air-gapped setups are restricted, since the runners for Dependabot updates <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.5/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/managing-self-hosted-runners-for-dependabot-updates#network-requirements-for-dependabot-runners">require internet access</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up GitHub Actions runners</h3>
<p>To configure a GitHub Actions runner, follow the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#prerequisites">steps</a> outlined in our documentation. GitHub Enterprise Server will provide you with a set of commands to run on your virtual machine that add self-hosted runners to the runner pool.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/github-actions/enabling-github-actions-for-github-enterprise-server/managing-self-hosted-runners-for-dependabot-updates">configuring a runner for Dependabot</a>, you must configure your runners with the <code>dependabot</code> label to indicate that this runner is available for Dependabot update jobs. You‚Äôll be prompted to add a label and a group. After running <code>./config.sh</code> in your terminal you‚Äôll see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you can use a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/admin/github-actions/getting-started-with-github-actions-for-your-enterprise/getting-started-with-self-hosted-runners-for-your-enterprise#3-manage-access-to-the-self-hosted-runner-using-a-group">runner group</a> to manage your Dependabot runners. If using repository or organization-level runner groups, make sure each runner is part of the Dependabot runner group and the repositories have access to this group you should have a runner group. Here is what your group would look like:</p>

<h3>Test Dependabot updates on a repository</h3>
<p>Navigate to a test repository, and go to Settings, then Security and Analysis. Enable Dependabot security updates. You may also configure Dependabot security updates at the organization level by following the same pattern.</p>
<p>If you would like to enable Dependabot version updates, you will need to add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file">configuration file</a> to each repository you want kept up-to-date.</p>
<p>You can test that Dependabot security updates are working properly by introducing a known bad dependency, for example, by adding a <code>requirements.txt</code> file with the following content.</p>
<p><code>requirements.txt</code> file</p>
<pre><code><br />pillow&gt;= 2.4.0, &lt; 5.3.1

</code></pre>
<p>Committing this file will trigger your repository to receive both Dependabot alerts and Dependabot security updates.</p>

<h2>How Dependabot on GHES differs from GitHub.com</h2>
<p>Dependabot creates pull requests by analyzing the available versions of your dependencies and calculating the lowest secure version that you should run. On GitHub.com, Dependabot runs this analysis using internal infrastructure developed before GitHub Actions was a product. With GHES appliances, we needed to find a way to process these containers so they would not impact the availability of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance, would play nice with a variety of GHES instances, and also would plug into a repo‚Äôs CI. This is where Actions come in. The images running to create update pull requests are packaged using GitHub Actions. Find out how this rearchitect came to life <a href="https://github.blog/2022-06-07-one-developers-journey-bringing-dependabot-to-github-enterprise-server/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Having Dependabot updates run in GitHub Actions means you get the niceties that come with Actions. For example, you can watch Dependabot create pull requests and monitor the logs just like you would with other actions!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1269" class="size-medium wp-image-65605 width-fit aligncenter" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1269" alt="/" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1269 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-3.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Please note that you cannot currently rerun jobs as you would with other Actions. Also, Dependabot on GHES only works with self-hosted runners.</p>

               <article><p>We strongly believe in using GitHub to build GitHub, keeping the developer experience streamlined and integrating directly into their workflows. We track our work in Issues, plan work in projects, and automate reminders through GitHub Actions and ChatOps. So, it&#8217;s natural that we would look to <a href="https://github.blog/2020-08-13-secure-at-every-step-a-guide-to-devsecops-shifting-left-and-gitops/">GitOps</a> to solve one of the more complex problems in IT security: Identity and Access Management (IAM). We wanted a solution that worked with our tools, was auditable, scalable, and well understood by developers. In this spirit, we built <a href="https://github.com/github/entitlements-app">Entitlements</a>, which uses a Git repository for the source-of-truth, declarative authorizations, and seamless integration with GitHub.com for approvals and audits. After years of development and countless contributions from GitHub employees, we are very excited to finally open source it!</p>
<h2>Alleviating IAM pain points with Entitlements</h2>
<h3>Audits</h3>
<p>Access requests and approvals are typically hard to track and audit. Without a scalable system in place, you may find yourself granting or requesting access that requires manual point-and-click actions. This makes it hard to track and prove audit controls. For instance, verifying appropriate approval and ensuring access revocation on termination or change of roles.</p>
<p>Entitlements leverages GitHub.com by storing its configuration in a repository and flowing all changes to those configurations through pull requests, so we have a durable audit trail of the request and its approvals.</p>
<p>Entitlements also supports metadata tags inside of the Entitlements configuration, which allows you to scan those configs and generate pull requests to audit and re-approve on a periodic basis. This supports enhanced auditing for your high risk configurations.</p>
<p>With expirations inside of the Entitlements configurations you can grant access to systems for an exact period of time with assurance that the access will be appropriately revoked after that time period.</p>
<p>Trust us‚Äîyour auditors will love you.</p>
<h3>Re-orgs</h3>
<p>It is natural for organizations large and small to re-organize team structures to adapt to changing business demands. When re-orgs happen, it is common for access to accumulate, leaving you with access from both your old role and your new role. Entitlements can help prevent this.</p>
<p>At GitHub, we periodically pull a list of our employees from our internal source of truth and output that to various groups. We create automatic groups per manager, per region, per level, and per business function. By referencing these automatic groups wherever possible, we can ensure that access is added and revoked appropriately when business needs or organizations change.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>A team managing IAM requests for a large company can quickly become overwhelmed with the scale. That team also needs admin access on every tool and service at the company in order to fulfill these access requests.</p>
<p>At GitHub, Entitlements manages access to over 500 internal services, hundreds of GitHub.com organizations, and thousands of GitHub.com teams. Entitlements acts as a true force multiplier, allowing a fairly small team to manage large scale IAM.</p>
<h3>Self-service</h3>
<p>Since the Entitlements configurations are stored on GitHub.com, changes are self-service and not blocked by any specific team. Anyone can make a pull request adding themselves to an Entitlement configuration, get the appropriate approvals, and deploy their own pull request. This is full end-to-end self-service for IAM requests.</p>
<h2>Entitlements on GitHub.com</h2>
<p>While you can use Entitlements with any Git repository, leveraging it with GitHub.com unlocks its full potential.</p>
<h3>Manager review</h3>
<p>Leveraging GitHub.com with Entitlements can allow you to verify that each access change has an accompanying manager review.</p>
<p>By parsing the Entitlements diff, you can write a simple GitHub Action to parse the diff for affected users and request their manager&#8217;s review on the pull request.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65574 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381" alt="Screenshot of manager approval workflow" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-3.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>You now have a full audit trail of the approval and deployment granting access.</p>
<h2>Strictly audited Entitlements</h2>
<p>GitHub.com can be used to enforce periodic reviews of Entitlements configurations which you deem to be high-risk.</p>
<p>You can write a simple cron job which checks each high-risk Entitlement configuration for a metadata tag, and parses the defined date. If that configuration contains a date which is older than the review time frame, a pull request can be created to re-approve the access.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65575 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381" alt="Screenshot of periodic review of high-risk entitlement" width="1024" height="381" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-2.png?resize=1024%2C381?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This allows you to prove that access is re-approved appropriately, and the approval and justification are tracked in Git history.</p>
<p>You can further leverage expirations in Entitlements to automatically expire these high-risk Entitlements configurations if they are not re-approved.</p>
<h2>Automatic updates from business data</h2>
<p>You can write a simple cron job which checks a business data source-of-truth for updates and pushes those updates to the Entitlements org chart. Entitlements will re-organize the group membership based off of this new data and automatically handle de-provisioning old access and re-provisioning new access for each new role.</p>

               <article><p>Nearly 5,000 public contributions were made every minute last year on GitHub. Merging pull requests, answering discussions, opening issues‚Äìit‚Äôs quite a feat to build and maintain all of the projects and communities that live on GitHub. As part of GitHub‚Äôs mission, we want to celebrate developers and their projects, while also showcasing the impact software has on the huge innovations of today, and the future. To date, we‚Äôve found ways to recognize developers whose commits <a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-19-open-source-goes-to-mars/">helped NASA conduct the first powered flight on Mars</a>, whose code was <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">archived for the next 1,000 years</a> in the Arctic Code Vault, and those who <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">sponsor the projects they care about</a>.</p>
<p>Available in public beta today, you‚Äôll start to see achievements show up on your and your fellow <em>open sourcerer‚Äôs</em> profiles. Achievements will commemorate developer milestones, whether it‚Äôs the first handful of commits or being a part of a flight on Mars.</p>
<h3>Introducing Achievements</h3>
<p>Profiles on GitHub give developers the opportunity to show off their favorite projects, contributions, and <em>all the things</em> that they choose to highlight in their <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme">profile README</a>. A lot of developers take great pride in their green squares (as well as the blank squares indicating time away!). We even have a way to <a href="https://skyline.github.com/">visualize your contribution graph in 3D</a>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="ü§Ø" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Achievements celebrate and showcase your journey on GitHub. You can take a trip down memory lane as you reminisce on some of your earlier work (yes, certain achievements will surface events dating back to the beginning!). You can also share them on social media to show off the new badges you‚Äôve earned. We‚Äôll only ship a few to start, but as we roll out more over time, achievements will begin to paint a clearer picture of you and the work you‚Äôre passionate about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65587 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602" alt="Galaxy Brain achievement" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602?w=1600 1600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-4.png?resize=1024%2C602?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: Displaying achievements on your profile is completely optional; by default, they can be seen by anyone viewing your public profile. You can opt out from having achievements displayed on your profile by going to your <a href="https://www.github.com/settings">profile settings</a>. If you previously opted out of any of the existing badges (Arctic Code Vault, GitHub Sponsor, Mars Helicopter 2020), you will be opted out by default.</p>
<h3>What achievements are there?</h3>
<p>Great question, we‚Äôll never tell <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92b.png" alt="ü§´" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>There‚Äôs a bit of whimsy, surprise, and delight that we hope you‚Äôll feel upon discovering achievements on your own profile, as well as on your fellow contributors&#8217; and maintainers‚Äô profiles. You will be able to infer the criteria to unlock certain achievements by viewing an achievement you‚Äôve earned, or by viewing someone else‚Äôs achievements. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As seen above, Galaxy Brain will celebrate your activity in discussions once another user has deemed your answer helpful. </span></p>
<h3>What will you achieve next?</h3>
<p>We‚Äôve got more achievements up our sleeve that we‚Äôll be releasing soon, so stay on the lookout.</p>
<p>That being said, we don‚Äôt expect to hit on every core milestone with our first run. We‚Äôre kicking off achievements with a ship-to-learn mentality. Let us know what we should be looking into next and what you‚Äôre most excited to recognize your community for.</p>
<p>Find us in <a href="https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/profile">the feedback discussion</a>. We can‚Äôt wait to hear from you!</p>

               <summary><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/">Sunsetting Atom</a> </summary>
               <article><p>When we formally introduced Atom in 2014, we set out to give developers a text editor that was deeply customizable but also easy to use‚Äîone that made it possible for more people to build software. While that goal of growing the software creator community remains, we‚Äôve decided to retire Atom in order to further our commitment to bringing fast and reliable software development to the cloud via Microsoft Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<p>Today, we‚Äôre announcing that we are sunsetting Atom and will archive all projects under the organization on December 15, 2022.</p>
<h3>Why are we doing this now?</h3>
<p>Atom has not had significant feature development for the past several years, though we‚Äôve conducted maintenance and security updates during this period to ensure we‚Äôre being good stewards of the project and product. As new cloud-based tools have emerged and evolved over the years, Atom community involvement has declined significantly. As a result, we‚Äôve decided to sunset Atom so we can focus on enhancing the developer experience in the cloud with GitHub Codespaces.</p>
<p>This is a tough goodbye. It‚Äôs worth reflecting that Atom has served as the foundation for the Electron framework,¬†which paved the way for the creation of thousands of apps, including Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Slack, and our very own GitHub Desktop. However, reliability, security, and performance are core to GitHub, and in order to best serve the developer community, we are archiving Atom to prioritize technologies that enable the future of software development.</p>
<h3>What happens next?</h3>
<p>We recognize that Atom is still used by the community and want to acknowledge that migrating to an alternative solution takes time and energy. We are committed to helping users and contributors plan for their migration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, we‚Äôre announcing the sunset date six months out.</li>
<li>Over the next six months, we‚Äôll continue to inform Atom users of the sunset in the product and on atom.io.</li>
<li>On December 15, 2022, we will archive the atom/atom repository and all other repositories remaining in the Atom organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thank you</h3>
<p>GitHub and our community have benefited tremendously from those who have filed issues, created extensions, fixed bugs, and built new features on Atom. Atom played an integral part in many developers‚Äô journeys, and we look forward to building and shaping the next chapter of software development together.</p>

               <article><p>With the launch of <a href="https://github.blog/2021-09-01-introducing-github-global-campus/">GitHub Global Campus</a>, a whole new class of students have found a home as a CS developer from those starting out building confidence in open source to the shining stars completing a project and switching to maintainership. One common barrier that all student developers face in their open source journeys is finding a safe space with peers, to build an engaged community, and generate exposure for projects for others to contribute. GitHub Education now provides a safe place for students to learn from and lean on each other with the launch of the Community Exchange within GitHub Global Campus.</p>
<h2>What can students do on Community Exchange?</h2>
<p>Community Exchange offers students the ability to connect with peers to learn valuable skills on their journey to become an open source contributor, or become better at their software development craft. Community Exchange allows students to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover student created repositories.</strong> Students have the ability to search submitted repositories by repository name, topics, as well as stars, forks, and issue counts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304097-d74e33ec-1179-4f40-8849-bd979903cfc0.gif?resize=1232%2C683&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1232" height="683" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Star repositories of interest.</strong> Whether you would like to revisit a repository later or show some appreciation for a well‚Äêmaintained project, you can apply stars to repositories from the Community Exchange gallery.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304155-afe3a16e-616a-4521-8b5f-f117054eed50.gif?resize=759%2C250&#038;ssl=1" width="759" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit a repository in need of collaborators.</strong> Students can designate their repository as a ‚Äúcollaborate‚Äù repository so other students know that contributions are welcome at any level.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304767-f48e908a-f3f1-41f3-bc8e-f2e7cf3c8bce.png?resize=589%2C314&#038;ssl=1" width="589" height="314" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submit a repository to teach students new skills.</strong> Maybe you have a skillset or knowledge you would like to pass on to your peers. Students can designate their repository as a ‚Äúlearn‚Äù repository so other students can learn step-by-step how to code the project in the repository&#8217;s LEARN.md file.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304723-6fdf270b-8e21-42d9-9405-b62524d07458.png?resize=589%2C333&#038;ssl=1" width="589" height="333" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage repository submissions.</strong> Students have full control over which repositories they would like to showcase on Community Exchange. They can remove repositories from the Community Exchange gallery or quick link to their repository to edit.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304883-e8b3974e-f700-4bc9-890d-b2cc58afb92f.png?resize=1201%2C356&#038;ssl=1" width="1201" height="356" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h2><strong>Why should I use Community Exchange?</strong></h2>
<p>While there are many twists and turns along an open-source journey, you don‚Äôt have to travel alone. With the GitHub Global Campus student community, you are surrounded by others who are also learning and eager to collaborate.</p>
<p>With Community Exchange you can also:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get exposure for your repository</strong>. Global Campus is the home for nearly two million student developers. Your project could become the student community&#8217;s next favorite repository.</li>
<li><strong>Build your portfolio</strong>. Whether you are interested in applying for an internship or a dream job, an active GitHub profile can go a long way.<br />
Help other students learn. Helping the student community learn new skills and technologies is another great way to contribute to GitHub, and develop mastery.</li>
<li><strong>Grow your network</strong>. Collaborate and interact with other Global Campus students via student repositories. A strong network can yield many professional opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Learn how to be a maintainer</strong>. Whether you have thought about trying maintainership or considered making a career out of becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub sponsors maintainer</a>, Community Exchange is the place to build your skills.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I get started with Community Exchange?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/76497559/172304865-307526ff-624d-46d1-8688-27b1c02cf7cf.gif?resize=1266%2C471&#038;ssl=1" width="1266" height="471" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

               <article><p>If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre <em>still </em>excited by last week‚Äôs news that <a href="https://github.blog/2022-05-31-github-enterprise-server-3-5-is-now-generally-available/">Dependabot is generally available</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES). Developers using GHES can now let Dependabot secure their dependencies and keep them up-to-date. You know who would have loved that? Me at my last job.</p>
<p>Before joining GitHub, I spent five years working on teams that relied on GHES to host our code. As a GHES user, I really, <em>really</em> wanted Dependabot. Here‚Äôs why.</p>
<h2><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f915.png" alt="ü§ï" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Dependencies</h2>
<p>One constant pain point for my previous teams was staying on top of dependencies. Creating a Rails project with <code>rails new</code> results in an app with 74 dependencies, Django apps start with 88 dependencies, and a project initialized with Create React App will have 1,432 dependencies!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://github.com/advisories">security vulnerabilities</a> happen, and they can expose your customers to existential risk, so it‚Äôs important they are handled as soon as they‚Äôre published.</p>
<p>As I‚Äôm most familiar with the Ruby ecosystem, I‚Äôll use <a href="https://nokogiri.org">Nokogiri</a>, a gem for parsing XML and HTML, to illustrate the process of manually resolving a vulnerability. Nokogiri has been a dependency of every Rails app I‚Äôve maintained. It‚Äôs also seen <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/product/59208/Nokogiri-Nokogiri.html?vendor_id=20514">seven vulnerabilities</a> since 2019. To fix these manually, we‚Äôve had to:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Clone `my_rails_app`</li>
<li aria-level="1">Track down and parse the <a href="https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases">Nokogiri release notes</a></li>
<li aria-level="1">Patch Nokogiri in `my_rails_app` to a non-vulnerable version</li>
<li aria-level="1">Push the changes and open a pull request</li>
<li aria-level="1">Wait for CI to pass</li>
<li aria-level="1">Get the necessary reviews</li>
<li aria-level="1">Deploy, observe, and merge</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just one of (at least) 74 dependencies in one Rails app. My team maintained 14 Rails apps in our microservices-based architecture, so we needed to repeat the process for each app. A single vulnerability would eat up days of engineering time. That‚Äôs just one dependency in one ecosystem. We also worked on apps written in Elixir, Python, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>
<p>If an engineer was patching vulnerabilities, they couldn‚Äôt pursue feature work, the thing our customers could actually see. This would, understandably, lead to conversations about which vulnerabilities were most likely to be exploited and which we could tolerate for now.</p>
<p class="purple-text text-gradient-purple-coral mt-6 mb-6">If we had Dependabot security updates, that process would have started with a pull request. What took an engineer days to complete on their own could have been done before lunch.</p>
<p>We could have invested in keeping <em>all</em> of our dependencies up-to-date. Incremental upgrades are typically easier to perform and pose less risk. They also give bad actors less time to find and exploit vulnerabilities. One of my previous teams was still running Rails 3.2, which was no longer maintained when Rails 6 was released six years later. As support phased out, we had to apply our own security patches to our codebase instead of getting them from the framework. This made upgrading even harder. We spent <em>years</em> trying to get to a supported version, but other product priorities always won out.</p>
<p>If my team had Dependabot version updates, Dependabot would have opened pull requests each time a new version of Rails was released. We‚Äôd still need to make changes to ensure our apps were compliant with the new versions, but the changes would be made incrementally, making the lift much lighter. But we didn‚Äôt have Dependabot. We had to upgrade manually, and that meant upgrading didn‚Äôt happen until it became a P0.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="width-fit alignnone wp-image-65533" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image1-2.png?w=64&#038;h=64&#038;crop=1&#038;resize=25%2C25" alt="" width="25" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" />A new home</h2>
<p>I joined GitHub in 2021 to work on Dependabot. Being intimately familiar with the challenges Dependabot could help address, I wanted to be part of the solution. Little did I know, the team was just starting the process of bringing Dependabot to GHES. Call it serendipity, a dream come true, or tea leaves arranged <em>just so.</em></p>
<p>I quickly realized why Dependabot wasn‚Äôt already on GHES. <a href="https://github.blog/2019-05-23-introducing-new-ways-to-keep-your-code-secure/">GitHub acquired Dependabot in 2019</a>, and it took some time to scale Dependabot to be able to secure GitHub‚Äôs millions of repositories. To achieve this, we ported the service‚Äôs backend to run on Moda, GitHub‚Äôs internal Kubernetes-based platform. The dependency update jobs that result in pull requests were updated to run on lightweight <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io">Firecracker VMs</a>, allowing Dependabot to create millions of pull requests in just hours. It was an impressive effort by a small team.</p>
<p>That effort, however, didn‚Äôt lend itself to the architecture of GHES, where everything runs on a single server with limited resources. An auto-scaling backend and network of VMs wasn‚Äôt an option. Instead, we needed to port Dependabot‚Äôs backend to run on Nomad, the container orchestration option on GHES. The jobs running on Firecracker VMs needed to run on our customers‚Äô hardware. Fortunately, organizations can self-host GitHub Actions runners in GHES, so we adapted them to run on GitHub Actions. We also had to adjust our development processes to support continuous delivery in the cloud and less frequent GHES releases.</p>
<p>The result is that developers relying on GHES now have the option to have their dependencies updated for them. Now, my former teammates can update their dependencies by:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Viewing the already opened pull request</li>
<li aria-level="1">Reviewing the pull request and the <em>included</em> release notes</li>
<li aria-level="1">Deploying, observing, and merging</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="width-fit alignnone wp-image-65536 size-large" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?resize=1024%2C681" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?w=1850 1850w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2-1.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We‚Äôre really proud of that. As for me, I get the immense satisfaction of knowing that I built something that will directly benefit my former teammates. It doesn‚Äôt get much better than that!</p>

               <article><p>GitHub‚Äôs supply chain security features help you understand what dependencies you use, be aware of vulnerabilities in those dependencies, and then patch them so you can get back to work. This helps keep your code secure. As the home for all developers, GitHub is enabling more projects to benefit from this functionality, and we now support the fastest growing language on GitHub: Rust. With the latest addition of Rust support in GitHub‚Äôs dependency graph, the entire suite of supply chain security features are available for Cargo files. Here‚Äôs an overview of what that looks like and what it means for you.</p>
<h1>Advisories</h1>
<p>The¬†<a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory Database</a>¬†is an open database of security advisories focused on high quality, actionable vulnerability information for developers. We‚Äôve published over 400 existing Rust vulnerabilities, a number which grows as we curate existing vulnerabilities and triage newly discovered ones. The majority of these vulnerabilities come from¬†<a href="https://rustsec.org/" rel="nofollow">RustSec</a>, an independent organization that collects, standardizes, and publishes security advisories related to Rust libraries.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre a Rust package maintainer, you can use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory">GitHub Security Advisories</a> to collaborate with vulnerability reporters to privately discuss and fix vulnerabilities before announcing them publicly. Additionally, if you‚Äôre aware of a Rust vulnerability with a CVE that isn‚Äôt in the GitHub Advisory Database you can report it through a <a href="https://github.com/github/advisory-database#contributions">community contribution</a>.</p>

<h1>Dependency graph</h1>
<p>The dependency graph analyzes a repository‚Äôs <code>Cargo.toml</code> and <code>Cargo.lock</code> files to determine the dependencies being used in your project. This serves as a backbone for Dependabot, which alerts you when there is a known vulnerability and creates pull requests to update the affected dependency. To view a repository‚Äôs detected dependencies, select the repository‚Äôs Insights tab, then select Dependency graph from the sidebar on the left.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1636" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65502 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1636" alt="&quot;" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1636 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image4.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The dependency graph is enabled by default for public repositories, but you must <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/securing-your-repository#managing-the-dependency-graph">enable it</a> for private repositories. If the dependency graph for your public repository hasn‚Äôt already been populated, it will be soon. Please note that we‚Äôre rolling out dependency graph support for Rust in two phases, and full package metadata for Rust dependencies (including mapping the packages to GitHub repositories) is coming in a future release.</p>
<p>You can prevent Rust vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place with the <a href="https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action">dependency review GitHub Action</a>. This action scans pull requests for changes in your Rust dependencies and identifies if any new ones have known vulnerabilities. You can then block them from being merged into your code.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="width-fit alignnone wp-image-65503 size-full" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image2.gif?resize=1177%2C800" alt="" width="1177" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h1>Dependabot alerts and security updates</h1>
<p>Dependabot alerts notify you when new vulnerabilities are discovered in Rust packages you‚Äôre already using, and Dependabot security updates will create pull requests that automatically upgrade your vulnerable Rust packages to a version without the vulnerability. You can configure both <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/configuring-notifications-for-dependabot-alerts">Dependabot alerts</a> and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates">Dependabot security updates</a> so you‚Äôre just getting the notifications and pull requests you want for your repository.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="1999" height="1573" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65504 width-fit" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1573" alt="&quot;" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=1999 1999w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=300&#038;resize=1999%2C1573 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image3-1.png?w=1536 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

               <article><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/astha_singhal">Astha Singhal</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lak5hmi5udheer">Lakshmi Sudheer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaaMarieee">Julia¬†Knecht</a></p><p>The Application Security teams at Netflix are responsible for securing the software footprint that we create to run the Netflix product, the Netflix studio, and the business. Our customers are product and engineering teams at Netflix that build these software services and platforms. The Netflix <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">cultural values</a> of ‚ÄòContext not Control‚Äô and ‚ÄòFreedom and Responsibility‚Äô strongly influence how we do Security at Netflix. Our goal is to manage security risks to Netflix via clear, opinionated security guidance, and by providing risk context to Netflix engineering teams to make pragmatic risk decisions at¬†scale.</p><p>A few years ago, we published <a href="https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/scaling-appsec-at-netflix-6a13d7ab6043">this</a> blog post about how we had organized our team to focus our bandwidth on scalable investments as opposed to just traditional Appsec functions, which were not scaling well in our rapidly growing environment. We leaned into the idea of <strong>strategic security partnerships</strong> and<strong> automation investments </strong>to create more leverage for application security. This became the foundation for our current org structure with teams focused on <strong>Appsec Partnerships</strong> and <strong>Appsec Engineering</strong>. In this operating model, we provided critical Appsec operational services to Netflix‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding bug bounty, pentesting, PSIRT (product security incident response), security reviews, and developer security education‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävia a shared on-call rotation.</p><figure><img alt="Team Structure v1" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/478/1*iB0hJcUd299OSmlQrve92g.jpeg" /></figure><p>Over the past few years, this model has allowed us to focus on investments like<strong> Secure by Default</strong> for baseline security controls,<strong> Security Self-Service</strong> for clear actionable guidance and <strong>Vulnerability Scanning at scale</strong> for software supply chain security. We wanted to share an update on learnings from this model, how our needs have evolved, and where we expect to go from¬†here.</p><p>Among the most notable wins, we have been able to utilize this scale focused approach to <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/the-show-must-go-on-securing-netflix-studios-at-scale-19b801c86479">productize</a> application security for our rapidly growing studio engineering ecosystem, standardize security baseline for all Enterprise apps, and build <a href="https://slideslive.com/38942583/securing-your-companys-crown-jewels-while-the-world-watches-the-crown?ref=tag-2196-latest">paved roads</a> to provide Secure by Default Authentication &amp; Authorization capabilities for central data engineering tools. Our focus has been on improving overall security assurance as opposed to just vulnerability prevention. We are now expanding this approach to more parts of our ecosystem. This mindset has also allowed us to invest our capacity for white-glove service towards reasonable residual risk and standard guidance so we can reduce the need for white-glove engagements in the long term (e.g., investment in an API proxy that provides baseline security controls for free as opposed to pentesting all applications that would eventually sit behind that API proxy). This approach has also allowed us to build strong relationships with central engineering teams at Netflix (Data Platform, Developer Tools, Cloud Infrastructure, IAM Product Engineering) that will continue to serve as central points of leverage for security in the long¬†term.</p><p>However, it has not been all sunshine and rainbows. On the partnership side, the bespoke nature of each partnership means that there isn‚Äôt consistency and redundancy built into the operating model and the related partnership artifacts (e.g., Security Strategy and Roadmap, Threat Model, Deliverable Tracking, Residual Risk Criteria, etc). This leads to insufficient context sharing and high operational churn every time we have personnel changes. The partnership charter has also grown laterally into the infrastructure space as we stack our leverage bets on infrastructure components (like Service Mesh, Container Platform, etc). The skill sets and domain depth in those partnerships has further diversified the skills on the team. But this is a tradeoff on our ability to serve generalized Appsec oncall needs like bug bounty triage with high consistency. Given that partnerships focus on long-running strategic initiatives, the wins can be few and far between and that can be difficult for team motivation. We also found various areas in which security partnership work bleeds into security product solutioning and it can be difficult to identify the appropriate handoff¬†points.</p><p>Additionally, as the complexity of our ecosystem grows, the goal of ‚Äúsingle PoC into information security‚Äù becomes increasingly more difficult to maintain. The team is now investing in <strong>consistency</strong> and <strong>scalability</strong> of partnership artifacts and communication channels, better <strong>redundancy</strong> and <strong>context sharing</strong> on the team through squad operating models, crisper <strong>engagement criteria</strong>, and <strong>definition of done</strong> for partnership engagements.</p><p>Our Appsec Engineering team builds products to help us scale, e.g.: a dynamic Asset Inventory that understands the nuances of our bespoke engineering ecosystem and how our applications and data relate to each other. This has evolved their identity to be a software engineering team that focuses on security problems as opposed to a security engineering team that writes code/software. Our hiring has reflected that shift, and we‚Äôve added more dedicated software engineers (SWEs) to the team to help us build out software. With this shift, we‚Äôve incorporated <strong>engineering best practices</strong>, and our products have appropriate investments toward <strong>reliability</strong> and <strong>sustainability</strong>. As the team skews towards more software engineering focused talent, ramping up to support the shared Appsec-focused on-call has been challenging.</p><p>While originally built to support AppSec use cases around providing guidance to developers in a self-service way, interest in the rich data and relationships we have in our tools, especially our Asset Inventory, has grown. As a result, we‚Äôve continued to invest in making our solutions scalable and accessible, so security engineers can get the data they need more easily to drive security use cases. We‚Äôve also discovered, through interviews with engineers, that self-service guidance doesn‚Äôt stand on its own. Moving forward, the team is investing in understanding our customer use cases better, and shifting our self-service story toward higher-context, more opinionated automated guidance to ensure developers have everything they need to make truly informed decisions about the security of their applications (similar to how they might make resiliency or other product decisions).</p><p>As the Netflix business and engineering workforce has grown, our software footprint has also grown and become more heterogeneous. At the same time, partnerships have grown more and more strategic, and engineering has grown more and more software-focused. As our team specialized, what emerged was a loss of strategic focus for our AppSec Professional Services charter. These services now need more dedicated strategic investment as the volume and support needs have grown. So, we are now building out a dedicated capability focused on these critical services that are important investments to be made and can no longer be served effectively via a shared Appsec on-call. This will be our <strong>‚ÄúAppsec Reviews and Assessments‚Äù</strong> function and we are <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/210140918">hiring</a> for passionate, early career Appsec engineers to join this¬†group.</p><figure><img alt="Team Structure v2" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/715/1*96PN1i-ScttDHm3NtKNCgw.jpeg" /></figure><p>We will continue to learn as we go through this next phase of evolution of our program. We hope to continue to share these learnings with the broader community interested in scalable product and application security.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=c9e0f1488bc5" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-appsec-at-netflix-part-2-c9e0f1488bc5">Scaling Appsec at Netflix (Part 2)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

               <article><p>At Netflix, we want to entertain the world through creating engaging content and helping members discover the titles they will love. Key to that is understanding causal effects that connect changes we make in the product to indicators of member¬†joy.</p><p>To measure causal effects we rely heavily on <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/decision-making-at-netflix-33065fa06481">AB testing</a>, but we also leverage <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/quasi-experimentation-at-netflix-566b57d2e362">quasi-experimentation</a> in cases where AB testing is limited. Many scientists across Netflix have contributed to the way that Netflix analyzes these causal¬†effects.</p><p>To celebrate that impact and learn from each other, Netflix scientists recently came together for an internal Causal Inference and Experimentation Summit. The weeklong conference brought speakers from across the content, product, and member experience teams to learn about methodological developments and applications in estimating causal effects. We covered a wide range of topics including difference-in-difference estimation, double machine learning, Bayesian AB testing, and causal inference in recommender systems among many¬†others.</p><p>We are excited to share a sneak peek of the event with you in this blog post through selected examples of the talks, giving a behind the scenes look at our community and the breadth of causal inference at Netflix. We look forward to connecting with you through a future external event and additional blog¬†posts!</p><h4>Incremental Impact of Localization</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yinghong-lan-2368656b">Yinghong Lan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinod-bakthavachalam">Vinod Bakthavachalam</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lavanyasharan">Lavanya Sharan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariedouriez/en">Marie Douriez</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bahareh-azarnoush">Bahar Azarnoush</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-kroll-19244946">Mason¬†Kroll</a></p><p>At Netflix, we are passionate about connecting our members with great stories that can come from anywhere, and be <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-hottest-travel-destinations-have-been-one-story-away">loved everywhere</a>. In fact, we stream in more than 30 languages and 190 countries and strive to localize the content, through subtitles and dubs, that our members will enjoy the most. Understanding the heterogenous incremental value of localization to member viewing is key to these¬†efforts!</p><p>In order to estimate the incremental value of localization, we turned to causal inference methods using historical data. Running large scale, randomized experiments has both technical and operational challenges, especially because we want to avoid withholding localization from members who might need it to access the content they¬†love.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-C41nO6__c1UwCHK" /><figcaption>Conceptual overview of using double machine learning to control for confounders and compare similar titles to estimate incremental impact of localization</figcaption></figure><p>We analyzed the data across various languages and applied double machine learning methods to properly control for measured confounders. We not only studied the impact of localization on overall title viewing but also investigated how localization adds value at different parts of the member journey. As a robustness check, we explored various simulations to evaluate the consistency and variance of our incrementality estimates. These insights have played a key role in our decisions to scale localization and delight our members around the¬†world.</p><p>A related application of causal inference methods to localization arose when some dubs were delayed due to pandemic-related shutdowns of production studios. To understand the impact of these dub delays on title viewing, we simulated viewing in the absence of delays using the method of synthetic control. We compared simulated viewing to observed viewing at title launch (when dubs were missing) and after title launch (when dubs were added¬†back).</p><p>To control for confounders, we used a placebo test to repeat the analysis for titles that were not affected by dub delays. In this way, we were able to estimate the incremental impact of delayed dub availability on member viewing for impacted titles. Should there be another shutdown of dub productions, this analysis enables our teams to make informed decisions about delays with greater confidence.</p><h4>Holdback Experiments for Product Innovation</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/traviscb1998">Travis Brooks</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cassianocoria">Cassiano Coria</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nettlesgreg">Greg Nettles</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/molly-jackman-1a757644">Molly Jackman</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clairelackner">Claire¬†Lackner</a></p><p>At Netflix, there are many examples of holdback AB tests, which show some users an experience without a specific feature. They have substantially improved the member experience by measuring long term effects of new features or re-examining old assumptions. However, when the topic of holdback tests is raised, it can seem too complicated in terms of experimental design and/or engineering costs.</p><p>We aimed to share best practices we have learned about holdback test design and execution in order to create more clarity around holdback tests at Netflix, so they can be used more broadly across product innovation teams¬†by:</p><ol><li>Defining the types of holdbacks and their use cases with past¬†examples</li><li>Suggesting future opportunities where holdback testing may be¬†valuable</li><li>Enumerating the challenges that holdback tests¬†pose</li><li>Identifying future investments that can reduce the cost of deploying and maintaining holdback tests for product and engineering teams</li></ol><p>Holdback tests have clear value in many product areas to confirm learnings, understand long term effects, retest old assumptions on newer members, and measure cumulative value. They can also serve as a way to test simplifying the product by removing unused features, creating a more seamless user experience. In many areas at Netflix they are already commonly used for these purposes.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hAIxB_t6oOabezbS" /><figcaption>Overview of how holdback tests work where we keep the current experience for a subset of members over the long term in order to gain valuable insights for improving the¬†product</figcaption></figure><p>We believe by unifying best practices and providing simpler tools, we can accelerate our learnings and create the best product experience for our members to access the content they¬†love.</p><h4>Causal Ranker: A Causal Adaptation Framework for Recommendation Models</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeongyoonlee">Jeong-Yoon Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/datamusing">Sudeep¬†Das</a></p><p>Most machine learning algorithms used in personalization and search, including deep learning algorithms, are purely associative. They learn from the correlations between features and outcomes how to best predict a¬†target.</p><p>In many scenarios, going beyond the purely associative nature to understanding the causal mechanism between taking a certain action and the resulting incremental outcome becomes key to decision making. Causal inference gives us a principled way of learning such relationships, and when coupled with machine learning, becomes a powerful tool that can be leveraged at¬†scale.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jTcnXuGax3_ZP2S2" /><figcaption>Compared to machine learning, causal inference allows us to build a robust framework that controls for confounders in order to estimate the true incremental impact to¬†members</figcaption></figure><p>At Netflix, many surfaces today are powered by recommendation models like the personalized rows you see on your homepage. We believe that many of these surfaces can benefit from additional algorithms that focus on making each recommendation as useful to our members as possible, beyond just identifying the title or feature someone is most likely to engage with. Adding this new model on top of existing systems can help improve recommendations to those that are right in the moment, helping find the exact title members are looking to stream¬†now.</p><p>This led us to create a framework that applies a light, causal adaptive layer on top of the base recommendation system called the Causal Ranker Framework. The framework consists of several components: impression (treatment) to play (outcome) attribution, true negative label collection, causal estimation, offline evaluation, and model¬†serving.</p><p>We are building this framework in a generic way with reusable components so that any interested team within Netflix can adopt this framework for their use case, improving our recommendations throughout the¬†product.</p><h4>Bellmania: Incremental Account Lifetime Valuation at Netflix and its Applications</h4><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamidreza-badri-97840347">Reza Badri</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/realallentran">Allen¬†Tran</a></p><p>Understanding the value of acquiring or retaining subscribers is crucial for any subscription business like Netflix. While customer lifetime value (LTV) is commonly used to value members, simple measures of LTV likely overstate the true value of acquisition or retention because there is always a chance that potential members may join in the future on their own without any intervention.</p><p>We establish a methodology and necessary assumptions to estimate the monetary value of acquiring or retaining subscribers based on a causal interpretation of incremental LTV. This requires us to estimate both on Netflix and off Netflix¬†LTV.</p><p>To overcome the lack of data for off Netflix members, we use an approach based on Markov chains that recovers off Netflix LTV from minimal data on non-subscriber transitions between being a subscriber and canceling over¬†time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*dwm-RhoCP_S9XdkQ" /><figcaption>Through Markov chains we can estimate the incremental value of a member and non member that appropriately captures the value of potential joins in the¬†future</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, we demonstrate how this methodology can be used to (1) forecast aggregate subscriber numbers that respect both addressable market constraints and account-level dynamics, (2) estimate the impact of price changes on revenue and subscription growth, and (3) provide optimal policies, such as price discounting, that maximize expected lifetime revenue of¬†members.</p><p>Measuring causality is a large part of the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-a-culture-of-learning-394bc7d0f94c">data science culture</a> at Netflix, and we are proud to have so many stunning colleagues leverage both experimentation and quasi-experimentation to drive member impact.

               <article><p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vkaushal21/">Vivek¬†Kaushal</a></p><p>At Netflix, we aim to provide recommendations that match our members‚Äô interests. To achieve this, we rely on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. ML algorithms can be only as good as the data that we provide to it. This post will focus on the large volume of high-quality data stored in Axion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour fact store that is leveraged to compute ML features offline. We built Axion primarily to remove any training-serving skew and make offline experimentation faster. We will share how its design has evolved over the years and the lessons learned while building¬†it.</p><h3>Terminology</h3><p>Axion fact store is part of our Machine Learning Platform, the platform that serves machine learning needs across Netflix. Figure 1 below shows how Axion interacts with Netflix‚Äôs ML platform. The overall ML platform has tens of components, and the diagram below only shows the ones that are relevant to this post. To understand Axion‚Äôs design, we need to know the various components that interact with¬†it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*a37mfb9KtcdEL_mn" /><figcaption>Figure 1: Netflix ML Architecture</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Fact: </strong>A fact is data about our members or videos. An example of data about members is the video they had watched or added to their My List. An example of video data is video metadata, like the length of a video. Time is a critical component of Axion‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWhen we talk about facts, we talk about facts at a moment in time. These facts are managed and made available by services like <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflixs-viewing-data-how-we-know-where-you-are-in-house-of-cards-608dd61077da">viewing history</a> or video metadata services outside of¬†Axion.</li><li><strong>Compute application: </strong>These applications generate recommendations for our members. They fetch facts from respective data services, run feature encoders to generate features and score the ML models to eventually generate recommendations.</li><li><strong>Offline feature generator: </strong>We regenerate the values of the features that were generated for inferencing in the compute application. Offline Feature Generator is a spark application that enables on-demand generation of features using new, existing, or updated feature encoders.</li><li><strong>Shared feature encoders: </strong>Feature encoders are shared between compute applications and offline feature generators. We make sure there is no training/serving skew by using the same data and the code for online and offline feature generation.</li></ul><h3>Motivation</h3><p>Five years ago, we <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/distributed-time-travel-for-feature-generation-389cccdd3907">posted</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiwKg8KynVU">talked</a> about the need for a ML fact store. The motivation has not changed since then; the design has. This post focuses on the new design, but here is a summary of why we built this fact¬†store.</p><p>Our machine learning models train on several weeks of data. Thus, if we want to run an experiment with a new or modified feature encoder, we need to build several weeks of feature data with this new or modified feature encoder. We have two options to collect features using this updated feature¬†encoder.</p><p>The first is to log features from the compute applications, popularly known as feature logging. We can deploy updated feature encoders in our compute applications and then wait for them to log the feature values. Since we train our models on several weeks of data, this method is slow for us as we will have to wait for several weeks for the data collection.</p><p>An alternative to feature logging is to regenerate the features with updated feature encoders. If we can access the historical facts, we can regenerate the features using updated feature encoders. Regeneration takes hours compared to weeks taken by the feature logging. Thus, we decided to go this route and started storing facts to reduce the time it takes to run an experiment with new or modified features.</p><h3>Design evolution</h3><p>Axion fact store has four components‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfact logging client, ETL, query client, and data quality infrastructure. We will describe how the design evolved in these components.</p><h3>Evolution of Fact Logging¬†Client</h3><p>Compute applications access facts (members‚Äô viewing history, their likes and my list information, etc.) from various <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/practical-api-design-at-netflix-part-1-using-protobuf-fieldmask-35cfdc606518">grpc services</a> that power the whole Netflix experience. These facts are used to generate features using shared feature encoders, which in turn are used by ML models to generate recommendations. After generating the recommendations, compute applications use Axion‚Äôs fact logging client to log these¬†facts.</p><p>At a later stage in the offline pipelines, the offline feature generator uses these logged facts to regenerate temporally accurate features. Temporal accuracy, in this context, is the ability to regenerate the exact set of features that were generated for the recommendations. This temporal accuracy of features is key to removing the training-serving skew.</p><p>The first version of our logger library optimized for storage by deduplicating facts and optimized for network i/o using different compression methods for each fact. Then we started hitting roadblocks while optimizing the query performance. Since we were optimizing at the logging level for storage and performance, we had less data and metadata to play with to optimize the query performance.</p><p>Eventually, we decided to simplify the logger. Now we asynchronously collect all the facts and metadata into a protobuf, compress it, and send it to the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/keystone-real-time-stream-processing-platform-a3ee651812a">keystone messaging service</a>.</p><h3>Evolution of ETL and Query¬†Client</h3><p>ETL and Query Client are intertwined, as any ETL changes could directly impact the query performance. ETL is the component where we experiment for query performance, improving data quality, and storage optimization. Figure 2 shows components of Axion‚Äôs ETL and its interaction with the query¬†client.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*DGVK0429DO9BPMwd" /><figcaption>Fig 2: Internal components of¬†Axion</figcaption></figure><p>Axion‚Äôs fact logging client logs facts to the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/keystone-real-time-stream-processing-platform-a3ee651812a">keystone real-time stream processing platform</a>, which outputs data to an <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/iceberg">Iceberg</a> table. We use Keystone as it is easy to use, reliable, scalable, and provides aggregation of facts from different cloud regions into a single AWS region. Having all data in a single AWS region exposes us to a single point of failure but it significantly reduces the operational overhead of our ETL pipelines which we believe makes it a worthwhile trade-off. We currently send all the facts into a single Keystone stream which we have configured to write to a single Iceberg table. We plan to split these Keystone streams into multiple streams for horizontal scalability.</p><p>The Iceberg table created by Keystone contains large blobs of unstructured data. These large unstructured blogs are not efficient for querying, so we need to transform and store this data in a different format to allow efficient queries. One might think that normalizing it would make storage and querying more efficient, albeit at the cost of writing more complex queries. Hence, our first approach was to normalize the incoming data and store it in multiple tables. We soon realized that, while space-optimized, it made querying very inefficient for the scale of data we needed to handle. We ran into various shuffle issues in Spark as we were joining several big tables at query¬†time.</p><p>We then decided to denormalize the data and store all facts and metadata in one Iceberg table using nested Parquet format. While storing in one Iceberg table was not as space-optimized, Parquet did provide us with significant savings in storage costs, and most importantly, it made our Spark queries succeed. However, Spark query execution remained slow. Further attempts to optimize query performance, like using bloom filters and predicate pushdown, were successful but still far away from where we wanted it to¬†be.</p><h3>Why was querying the single Iceberg table¬†slow?</h3><p>What‚Äôs our end goal? We want to train our ML models to personalize the member experience. We have a plethora of ML models that drive personalization. Each of these models are trained with different datasets and features along with different stratification and objectives. Given that Axion is used as the defacto Fact store for assembling the training dataset for all these models, it is important for Axion to log and store enough facts that would be sufficient for all these models. However, for a given ML model, we only require a subset of the data stored in Axion for its training needs. We saw queries filtering down an input dataset of several hundred million rows to less than a million in extreme cases. Even with bloom filters, the query performance was slow because the query was downloading all of the data from s3 and then dropping it. As our label dataset was also random, presorting facts data also did not¬†help.</p><p>We realized that our options with Iceberg were limited if we only needed data for a million rows‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääout of several hundred million‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand we had no additional information to optimize our queries. So we decided not to further optimize joins with the Iceberg data and instead move to an alternate approach.</p><h3>Low-latency Queries</h3><p>To avoid downloading all of the fact data from s3 in a spark executor and then dropping it, we analyzed our query patterns and figured out that there is a way to only access the data that we are interested in. This was achieved by introducing an <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/EVCache">EVCache</a>, a key-value store, which stores facts and indices optimized for these particular query patterns.</p><p>Let‚Äôs see how the solution works for one of these query patterns‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääquerying by member id. We first query the index by member id to find the keys for the facts of that member and query those facts from EVCache in parallel. So, we make multiple calls to the key-value store for each row in our training set. Even when accounting for these multiple calls, the query performance is an order of magnitude faster than scanning several hundred times more data stored in the Iceberg table. Depending on the use case, EVCache queries can be 3x-50x faster than¬†Iceberg.</p><p>The only problem with this approach is that EVCache is more expensive than Iceberg storage, so we need to limit the amount of data stored. So, for the queries that request data not available in EVCache, our only option is to query Iceberg. In the future, we want to store all facts in EVCache by optimizing how we store data in¬†EVCache.</p><h3>How do we monitor the quality of¬†data?</h3><p>Over the years, we learned the importance of having comprehensive data quality checks for our datasets. Corruption in data can significantly impact production model performance and A/B test results. From the ML researchers‚Äô perspective, it doesn‚Äôt matter if Axion or a component outside of Axion corrupted the data. When they read the data from Axion, if it is bad, it is a loss of trust in Axion. For Axion to become the defacto fact store for all Personalization ML models, the research teams needed to trust the quality of data stored. Hence, we designed a comprehensive system that monitors the quality of data flowing through Axion to detect corruptions, whether introduced by Axion or outside¬†Axion.</p><p>We bucketed data corruptions observed when reading data from Axion on three dimensions:</p><ul><li>The impact on a value in data: Was the value missing? Did a new value appear (unintentionally)? Was the value replaced with a different value?</li><li>The spread of data corruption: Did data corruption have a row or columnar impact? Did the corruption impact one pipeline or multiple ML pipelines?</li><li>The source of data corruption: Was data corrupted by components outside of Axion? Did Axion components corrupt data? Was data corrupted at¬†rest?</li></ul><p>We came up with three different approaches to detect data corruption, wherein each approach can detect corruption along multiple dimensions described above.</p><h3>Aggregations</h3><p>Data volume logged to Axion datastore is predictable. Compute applications follow daily trends. Some log consistently every hour, others log for a few hours every day. We aggregate the counts on dimensions like total records, compute application, fact counts etc. Then we use a rule-based approach to validate the counts are within a certain threshold of past trends. Alerts are triggered when counts vary outside these thresholds. These trend-based alerts are helpful with missing or new data; row-level impact, and pipelines impact. They help with column-level impact only on rare occasions.</p><h3>Consistent sampling</h3><p>We sample a small percentage of the data based on a predictable member id hash and store it in separate tables. By consistent sampling across different data stores and pipelines, we can run canaries on this smaller subset and get output quickly. We also compare the output of these canaries against production to detect unintended changes in data during new code deployment. One downside of consistent sampling is that it may not catch rare issues, especially if the rate of data corruption is significantly lower than our sampling rate. Consistent sampling checks help detect attribute impact‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänew, missing, or replacement; columnar impact, and single pipeline¬†issues.</p><h3>Random sampling</h3><p>While the above two strategies combined can detect most data corruptions, they do occasionally miss. For those rare occasions, we rely on random sampling. We randomly query a subset of the data multiple times every hour. Both hot and cold data, i.e., recently logged data and data logged a while ago, are randomly sampled. We expect these queries to pass without issues. When they fail, it is either due to bad data or issues with the underlying infrastructure. While we think of it as an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling lucky‚Äù strategy, it does work as long as we read significantly more data than the rate of corrupted data.</p><p>Another advantage to random sampling is maintaining the quality of unused facts. Axion users do not read a significant percentage of facts logged to Axion, and we need to make sure that these unused facts are of good quality as they can be used in the future. We have pipelines that randomly read these unused facts and alert when the query does not get the expected output. In terms of impact, these random checks are like winning a lottery‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou win occasionally, and you never know how big it¬†is.</p><h3>Results from monitoring data¬†quality</h3><p>We deployed the above three monitoring approaches more than two years ago, and since then, we have identified more than 95% of data issues early. We have also significantly improved the stability of our customer pipelines. If you want to know more about how we monitor data quality in Axion, you can check our <a href="https://databricks.com/session_na20/an-approach-to-data-quality-for-netflix-personalization-systems">spark summit talk</a> and <a href="https://databand.ai/mad-data-podcast/where-should-data-quality-sit-it-depends/">this¬†podcast</a>.</p><h3>Learnings from Axion‚Äôs evolution</h3><p>We learned from designing this fact store to start with a simple design and avoid premature optimizations that add complexity. Pay the storage, network, and compute cost. As the product becomes available to the customers, new use cases will pop up that will be harder to support with a complex design. Once the customers have adopted the product, start looking into optimizations.</p><p>While ‚Äú<em>keep the design simple</em>‚Äù is a frequently shared learning in software engineering, it is not always easy to achieve. For example, we learned that our fact logging client can be simple with minimal business logic, but our query client needs to be functionality-rich. Our learning is that if we need to add complexity, add it in the least number of components instead of spreading it¬†out.</p><p>Another learning is that we should have invested early into a robust testing framework. Unit tests and integration tests only took us so far. We needed scalability testing and performance testing as well. This scalability and performance testing framework helped stabilize the system because, without it, we ran into issues that took us weeks to clean¬†up.</p><p>Lastly, we learned that we should run data migrations and push the breaking API changes as soon as possible. As more customers adopt Axion, running data migrations and making breaking API changes are becoming harder and¬†harder.</p><h3>Conclusion and future¬†work</h3><p>Axion is our primary data source that is used extensively by all our <a href="https://research.netflix.com/research-area/recommendations">Personalization ML models</a> for offline feature generation. Given that it ensures that there is no training/serving skew and that it has significantly reduced offline feature generation latencies we are now starting to make it the defacto Fact store for other ML use cases within¬†Netflix.</p><p>We do have use cases that are not served well with the current design, like bandits, because our current design limits storing a map per row creating a limitation when a compute application needs to log multiple values for the same key. Also, as described in the design, we want to optimize how we store data in EVCache to enable us to store more¬†data.</p><p>If you are interested in working on similar challenges, <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/search">join¬†us</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5941d3231762" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/evolution-of-ml-fact-store-5941d3231762">Evolution of ML Fact Store</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

               <article><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahutter/">Alex Hutter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/falgunijhaveri/">Falguni Jhaveri</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/senthilsayeebaba/">Senthil Sayeebaba</a></p><p>Over the past few years <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-studio-engineering-overview-ed60afcfa0ce">Content Engineering</a> at Netflix has been transitioning many of its services to use a federated GraphQL platform. GraphQL federation enables domain teams to independently build and operate their own <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-the-netflix-domain-graph-service-framework-graphql-for-spring-boot-92b9dcecda18">Domain Graph Services</a> (DGS) and, at the same time, connect their domain with other domains in a unified GraphQL schema exposed by a <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-scales-its-api-with-graphql-federation-part-1-ae3557c187e2">federated gateway</a>.</p><p>As an example, let‚Äôs examine three core entities of the graph, each owned by separate engineering teams:</p><ol><li><strong>Movie</strong>: At Netflix, we make titles (shows, films, shorts etc.). For simplicity, let‚Äôs assume each title is a <strong>Movie</strong>¬†object.</li><li><strong>Production</strong>: Each Movie is associated with a Studio Production. A <strong>Production</strong> object tracks everything needed to make a <strong>Movie</strong> including shooting location, vendors, and¬†more.</li><li><strong>Talent</strong>: the people working on a <strong>Movie</strong> are the <strong>Talent</strong>, including actors, directors, and so¬†on.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*zWqzYt1KvSpkVSSL" /><figcaption>Sample GraphQL¬†Schema</figcaption></figure><p>Once entities like the above are available in the graph, it‚Äôs very common for folks to want to query for a particular entity based on attributes of related entities, e.g. give me all movies that are currently in photography with Ryan Reynolds as an¬†actor.</p><p>In a federated graph architecture, how can we answer such a query given that each entity is served by its own service? The <strong>Movie</strong> service would need to provide an endpoint that accepts a query and filters that may <strong><em>apply to data the service does not own,</em></strong> and use those to identify the appropriate Movie entities to¬†return.</p><p>In fact, <strong><em>every entity owning service could be required to do this¬†work</em>.</strong></p><p>This common problem of making a federated graph searchable led to the creation of <strong>Studio¬†Search</strong>.</p><p>The Studio Search platform was designed to take a portion of the federated graph, a subgraph rooted at an entity of interest, and make it searchable. The entities of the subgraph can be queried with text input, filtered, ranked, and faceted. In the next section, we‚Äôll discuss how we made this possible.</p><h3>Introducing Studio¬†Search</h3><p>When hearing that we want to enable teams to search <strong><em>something</em></strong><em>,</em> your mind likely goes to building an index of some kind. Ours did too! So we need to build an index of a portion of the federated graph.</p><p>How do our users tell us which portion and, even more critically, given that the portion of the graph of interest will almost definitely span data exposed by many services, how do we keep the index current with all these various services?</p><p>We chose <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> as the underlying technology for our index and determined that there were three main pieces of information required to build out an indexing pipeline:</p><ul><li>A definition of their subgraph of interest rooted at the entity they primarily will be searching for</li><li>Events to notify the platform of changes to entities in the¬†subgraph</li><li>Index specific configuration such as whether a field should be used for full text queries or whether a sub-document is¬†nested</li></ul><p>In short, our solution was to build an index for the subgraphs of interest. This index needs to be kept up-to-date with the data exposed by the various services in the federated graph in near-real time.</p><p>GraphQL gives us a straightforward way to define the subgraph‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa single templated GraphQL query that pulls all of the data the user is interested in using in their searches.</p><p>Here‚Äôs an example GraphQL query template. It‚Äôs pulling data for Movies and their related Productions and¬†Talent.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/706/1*9FhJnH2MiYQvFHysmSQpuA.png" /><figcaption><em>Sample GraphQL¬†query</em></figcaption></figure><p>To keep the index up to date, events are used to trigger a reindexing operation for individual entities when they change. <strong><em>Change Data Capture</em></strong> (CDC) events are the preferred events for triggering these operations‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämost teams produce them using Netflix‚Äôs <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/dblog-a-generic-change-data-capture-framework-69351fb9099b">CDC connectors</a>‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähowever, <strong><em>application events</em></strong> are also supported when necessary.</p><p>All data to be indexed is being fetched from the federated graph so all that is needed in the events is an entity id; the id can be substituted into the GraphQL query template to fetch the entity and any related¬†data.</p><p>Using the type information present in the GraphQL query template and the user specified index configuration we were able to create an index template with a set of custom Elasticsearch text analyzers that generalized well across¬†domains.</p><p>Given these inputs, a <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/data-movement-in-netflix-studio-via-data-mesh-3fddcceb1059">Data Mesh</a> pipeline can be created that consists of the user provided CDC event source, a processor to enrich those events using the user provided GraphQL query and a sink to Elasticsearch.</p><h3>Architecture</h3><p>Putting this all together, below you can see a simplified view of the architecture.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LfYcAWOrhjbp9mA7" /><figcaption><em>Studio Search Indexing Architecture</em></figcaption></figure><ol><li>Studio applications produce events to schematized <strong>Kafka</strong> streams within Data¬†Mesh.</li></ol><p>a. By transacting with a database which is monitored by a CDC connector that creates events,¬†or</p><p>b. By directly creating events using a Data Mesh¬†client.</p><p>2. The schematized events are consumed by Data Mesh processors implemented in the <strong>Apache<em> </em>Flink</strong> framework. Some entities have multiple events for their changes so we leverage union processors to combine data from multiple Kafka¬†streams.</p><p>a. A GraphQL processor executes the user provided GraphQL query to fetch documents from the federated gateway.</p><p>b. The federated gateway, in turn, fetches data from the Studio applications.</p><p>3. The documents fetched from the federated gateway are put onto another schematized Kafka topic before being processed by an <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> sink in Data Mesh that indexes them into Elasticsearch index configured with an indexing template created specifically for the fields and types present in the document.</p><h3>Reverse lookups</h3><p>You may have noticed something missing in the above explanation. If the index is being populated based on <strong>Movie</strong> id events, how does it stay up to date when a <strong>Production</strong> or <strong>Talent</strong> changes? Our solution to this is a reverse lookup‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen a change to a related entity is made, we need to look up all of the primary entities that could be affected and trigger events for those. We do this by consulting the index itself and querying for all primary entities related to the entity that has¬†changed.</p><p>For instance if our index has a document that looks like¬†this:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*qBiCX79OcsHNvXSh" /><figcaption><em>Sample Elasticsearch document</em></figcaption></figure><p>And the pipeline observes a change to the <strong>Production</strong> with ptpId ‚Äúabc‚Äù, we can query the index for all documents with production.ptpId == ‚Äúabc‚Äù and extract the movieId. Then, we can pass that movieId down into the rest of the indexing pipeline.</p><h3>Scaling the¬†Solution</h3><p>The solution we came up with worked quite well. Teams were easily able to share the requirements for their subgraph‚Äôs index via a GraphQL query template and could use existing tooling to generate the events to enable the index to be kept up to date in near real-time. Reusing the index itself to power reverse lookups enabled us to keep all the logic for handling related entities contained within our systems and shield our users from that complexity. In fact it worked so well that we became inundated with requests to integrate with Studio Search‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit began to power a significant portion of the user experience for many applications within Content Engineering.</p><p>Early on, we did integrations by hand but as adoption of Studio Search took off this did not scale. We needed to build tools to help us <strong><em>automate</em></strong> as much of the <strong><em>provisioning</em></strong> of the pipelines as possible. In order to get there we identified four main problems we needed to¬†solve:</p><ul><li>How to collect all the required configuration for the pipeline from¬†users.</li><li>Data Mesh streams are schematized with Avro. In the previous architecture diagram, in <strong>3)</strong> there is a stream carrying the results of the GraphQL query to the Elasticsearch sink. The response from GraphQL can contain 10s of fields, often nested. Writing an Avro schema for such a document is time consuming and error prone to do by hand. We needed to make this step much¬†easier.</li><li>Similarly the generation of the Elasticsearch template was time consuming and error prone. We needed to determine how to generate one based on the users‚Äô configuration.</li><li>Finally, creating Data Mesh pipelines manually was time consuming and error prone as well due to the volume of configuration required.</li></ul><h3>Configuration</h3><p>For collecting the indexing pipeline configuration from users we defined a single configuration file that enabled users to provide a high level description of their pipeline that we can use to programmatically create the indexing pipeline in Data Mesh. By using this high-level description we were able to greatly simplify the pipeline creation process for users by filling in common yet required configuration for the Data Mesh pipeline.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/487/1*jw8US5Z96Sspa9vffxjphA.png" /><figcaption><em>Sample¬†.yaml configuration</em></figcaption></figure><h3>Avro schema &amp; Elasticsearch index template generation</h3><p>The approach for both schema and index template generation was very similar. Essentially it required taking the user provided GraphQL query template and generating JSON from it. This was done using <a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/">graphql-java</a>. The steps required are enumerated below:</p><ul><li>Introspect the federated graph‚Äôs schema and use the response to build a GraphQLSchema object</li><li>Parse and validate the user provided GraphQL query template against the¬†schema</li><li>Visit the nodes of the query using utilities provided by graphql-java and collect the results into a JSON object‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis generated object is the schema/template</li></ul><h3>Deployment</h3><p>The previous steps centralized all the configuration in a single file and provided tools to generate additional configuration for the pipeline‚Äôs dependencies. Now all that was required was an entry point for users to provide their configuration file for orchestrating the provisioning of the indexing pipeline. Given our user base was other engineers we decided to provide a command line interface (CLI) written in Python. Using Python we were able to get the first version of the CLI to our users quickly. Netflix provides tooling that makes the CLI auto-update which makes the CLI easy to iterate on. The CLI performs the following tasks:</p><ul><li>Validates the provided configuration file</li><li>Calls a service to generate the Avro schema &amp; Elasticsearch index¬†template</li><li>Assembles the logical plan for the Data Mesh pipeline and creates it using Data Mesh¬†APIs</li></ul><p>A CLI is just a step towards a better self-service deployment process. We‚Äôre currently exploring options for treating these indices and their pipelines as <strong><em>declarative infrastructure </em></strong><em>managed</em> within the application that consumes¬†them.</p><h3>Current Challenges</h3><p>Using the federated graph to provide the documents for indexing simplifies much of the indexing process but it also creates its own set of challenges. If the challenges below sound exciting to you, come <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/">join¬†us</a>!</p><h3>Backfill</h3><p>Bootstrapping a new index for the addition or removal of attributes or refreshing an established index both add considerable additional and spiky load to the federated gateway and the component DGSes. Depending on the cardinality of the index and the complexity of its query we may need to coordinate with service owners and/or run backfills off peak. We continue to manage tradeoffs between reindexing speed and¬†load.</p><h3>Reverse Lookups</h3><p>Reverse lookups, while convenient, are not particularly user friendly. They introduce a circular dependency in the pipeline‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou can‚Äôt create the indexing pipeline without reverse lookups and reverse lookups need the index to function‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich we‚Äôve mitigated although it still creates some confusion. They also require the definer of the index to have detailed knowledge of the eventing for related entities they want to include and that may cover many different domains depending on the index‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have one index covering eight¬†domains.</p><h3>Index consistency</h3><p>As an index becomes more complex it is likely to depend on more DGSes and the likelihood of errors increases when fetching the required documents from the federated graph. These errors can lead to documents in the index being <strong><em>out of date</em></strong> or even <strong><em>missing</em></strong> altogether. The owner of the index is often required to follow up with other domain teams regarding errors in related entities and be in the unenviable position of not being able to do much to resolve the issues independently. When the errors are resolved, the process of replaying the failed events is manual and there can be a lag when the service is again successfully returning data but the index does not match¬†it.</p><h3>Stay Tuned</h3><p>In this post, we described how our indexing infrastructure moves data for any given subgraph of the Netflix Content federated graph to Elasticsearch and keeps that data in sync with the source of truth. In an upcoming post, we‚Äôll describe how this data can be queried without actually needing to know anything about Elasticsearch.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anoop-panicker/">Anoop Panicker</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bolei1007/">Bo Lei</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/czhao/">Charles Zhao</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdhanaraj/">Chris Dhanaraj</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hemamalinikannan/">Hemamalini Kannan</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimpisaacs/"> Jim Isaacs</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnycc321/">Johnny Chang</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasturi-chatterjee-a900715/">Kasturi Chatterjee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-banala/">Kishore Banala</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinzhu/">Kevin Zhu</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaslee4/">Tom Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonylxc/">Tongliang Liu</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarshshrivastava/">Utkarsh Shrivastava</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentbello/">Vince Bello</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinodvish/">Vinod Viswanathan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchengzeng/">Yucheng¬†Zeng</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5c0c1c7d7eaf" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/how-netflix-content-engineering-makes-a-federated-graph-searchable-5c0c1c7d7eaf">How Netflix Content Engineering makes a federated graph searchable</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

               <article><p>By: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gulatiankush/">Ankush Gulati</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgevorkyan/">David Gevorkyan</a><br>Additional credits: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-clark-621880/">Michael Clark</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gokhan-ozer-94407822/">Gokhan¬†Ozer</a></p><h3>Intro</h3><p>Netflix has more than 220 million active members who perform a variety of actions throughout each session, ranging from renaming a profile to watching a title. Reacting to these actions in near real-time to keep the experience consistent across devices is critical for ensuring an optimal member experience. This is not an easy task, considering the wide variety of supported devices and the sheer volume of actions our members perform. To this end, we developed a <strong>Rapid Event Notification System</strong> (RENO) to support use cases that require server initiated communication with devices in a scalable and extensible manner.</p><p>In this blog post, we will give an overview of the Rapid Event Notification System at Netflix and share some of the learnings we gained along the¬†way.</p><h3>Motivation</h3><p>With the rapid growth in Netflix member base and the increasing complexity of our systems, our architecture has evolved into an asynchronous one that enables both online and offline computation. Providing a seamless and consistent Netflix experience across various platforms (iOS, Android, smart TVs, Roku, Amazon FireStick, web browser) and various device types (mobile phones, tablets, televisions, computers, set top boxes) requires more than the traditional request-response model. Over time, we‚Äôve seen an increase in use cases where backend systems need to initiate communication with devices to notify them of member-driven changes or experience updates quickly and consistently.</p><h3>Use cases</h3><ul><li><strong>Viewing Activity<br></strong>When a member begins to watch a show, their ‚ÄúContinue Watching‚Äù list should be updated across all of their devices to reflect that¬†viewing.</li><li><strong>Personalized Experience Refresh<br></strong>Netflix Recommendation engine continuously refreshes recommendations for every member. The updated recommendations need to be delivered to the device timely for an optimal member experience.</li><li><strong>Membership Plan Changes<br></strong>Members often change their plan types, leading to a change in their experience that must be immediately reflected across all of their¬†devices.</li><li><strong>Member ‚ÄúMy List‚Äù Updates</strong><br>When members update their ‚ÄúMy List‚Äù by adding or removing titles, the changes should be reflected across all of their¬†devices.</li><li><strong>Member Profile Changes<br></strong>When members update their account settings like add/delete/rename profiles or change their preferred maturity level for content, these updates must be reflected across all of their¬†devices.</li><li><strong>System Diagnostic Signals<br></strong>In special scenarios, we need to send diagnostic signals to the Netflix app on devices to help troubleshoot problems and enable tracing capabilities.</li></ul><h3>Design Decisions</h3><p>In designing the system, we made a few key decisions that helped shape the architecture of¬†RENO:</p><ol><li>Single Events¬†Source</li><li>Event Prioritization</li><li>Hybrid Communication Model</li><li>Targeted Delivery</li><li>Managing High¬†RPS</li></ol><h4>Single Events¬†Source</h4><p>The use cases we wanted to support originate from various internal systems and member actions, so we needed to listen for events from several different microservices. At Netflix, our near-real-time event flow is managed by an internal distributed computation framework called Manhattan (you can learn more about it <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/system-architectures-for-personalization-and-recommendation-e081aa94b5d8">here</a>). We leveraged Manhattan‚Äôs event management framework to create a level of indirection serving as the single source of events for¬†RENO.</p><h4>Event Prioritization</h4><p>Considering the use cases were wide ranging both in terms of their sources and their importance, we built segmentation into the event processing. For example, a member-triggered event such as ‚Äú<em>change in a profile‚Äôs maturity level‚Äù</em> should have a much higher priority than a ‚Äú<em>system diagnostic signal‚Äù.</em> We thus assigned a priority to each use case and sharded event traffic by routing to priority-specific queues and the corresponding event processing clusters. This separation allows us to tune system configuration and scaling policies independently for different event priorities and traffic patterns.</p><h4>Hybrid Communication Model</h4><p>As mentioned earlier in this post, one key challenge for a service like RENO is supporting multiple platforms. While a mobile device is almost always connected to the internet and reachable, a smart TV is only online while in use. This network connection heterogeneity made choosing a single delivery model difficult. For example, entirely relying on a Pull model wherein the device frequently calls home for updates would result in chatty mobile apps. That in turn will be triggering the per-app communication limits that iOS and Android platforms enforce (we also need to be considerate of low bandwidth connections). On the other hand, using only a Push mechanism would lead smart TVs to miss notifications while they are powered off during most of the day. We therefore chose a hybrid Push AND Pull communication model wherein the server tries to deliver notifications to all devices immediately using Push notifications, and devices call home at various stages of the application lifecycle.</p><p>Using a Push-and-Pull delivery model combination also supports devices limited to a single communication model. This includes older, legacy devices that do not support Push Notifications.</p><h4>Targeted Delivery</h4><p>Considering the use cases were wide ranging in terms of both sources and target device types, we built support for device specific notification delivery. This capability allows notifying specific device categories as per the use case. When an actionable event arrives, RENO applies the use case specific business logic, gathers the list of devices eligible to receive this notification and attempts delivery. This helps limit the outgoing traffic footprint considerably.</p><h4>Managing High¬†RPS</h4><p>With over 220 million members, we were conscious of the fact that a service like RENO needs to process many events per member during a viewing session. At peak times, RENO serves about 150k events per second. Such a high RPS during specific times of the day can create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem">thundering herd problem</a> and put strain on internal and external downstream services. We therefore implemented a few optimizations:</p><ul><li><strong>Event Age<br></strong>Many events that need to be notified to the devices are time sensitive, and they are of no or little value unless sent almost immediately. To avoid processing old events, a staleness filter is applied as a gating check. If an event age is older than a configurable threshold, it is not processed. This filter weeds out events that have no value to the devices early in the processing phase and protects the queues from being flooded due to stale upstream events that may have been backed¬†up.</li><li><strong>Online Devices<br></strong>To reduce the ongoing traffic footprint, notifications are sent only to devices that are currently online by leveraging an existing registry that is kept up-to-date by Zuul (learn more about it¬†<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/tagged/zuul">here</a>).</li><li><strong>Scaling Policies<br></strong>To address the thundering herd problem and to keep latencies under acceptable thresholds, the cluster scale-up policies are configured to be more aggressive than the scale-down policies. This approach enables the computing power to catch up quickly when the queues¬†grow.</li><li><strong>Event Deduplication<br></strong>Both iOS and Android platforms aggressively restrict the level of activity generated by backgrounded apps, hence the reason why incoming events are deduplicated in RENO. Duplicate events can occur in case of high RPS, and they are merged together when it does not cause any loss of context for the¬†device.</li><li><strong>Bulkheaded Delivery<br></strong>Multiple downstream services are used to send push notifications to different device platforms including external ones like Apple Push Notification Service (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=push-notifications">APNS</a>) for Apple devices and Google‚Äôs Firebase Cloud Messaging (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">FCM</a>) for Android. To safeguard against a downstream service bringing down the entire notification service, the event delivery is parallelized across different platforms, making it best-effort per platform. If a downstream service or platform fails to deliver the notification, the other devices are not blocked from receiving push notifications.</li></ul><h3>Architecture</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*i6o12AqlvqZDMcAj" /></figure><p>As shown in the diagram above, the RENO service can be broken down into the following components.</p><h4>Event Triggers</h4><p>Member actions and system-driven updates that require refreshing the experience on members‚Äô¬†devices.</p><h4>Event Management Engine</h4><p>The near-real-time event flow management framework at Netflix referred to as Manhattan can be configured to listen to specific events and forward events to different queues.</p><h4>Event Priority Based¬†Queues</h4><p>Amazon SQS queues that are populated by priority-based event forwarding rules are set up in Manhattan to allow priority based sharding of¬†traffic.</p><h4>Event Priority Based¬†Clusters</h4><p>AWS Instance Clusters that subscribe to the corresponding queues with the same priority. They process all the events arriving on those queues and generate actionable notifications for¬†devices.</p><h4>Outbound Messaging System</h4><p>The Netflix messaging system that sends in-app push notifications to members is used to send RENO-produced notifications on the last mile to mobile devices. This messaging system is described in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/building-a-cross-platform-in-app-messaging-orchestration-service-86ba614f92d8">this blog¬†post</a>.</p><p>For notifications to web, TV &amp; other streaming devices, we use a homegrown push notification solution ‚Äã‚Äãcalled Zuul Push that provides ‚Äúalways-on‚Äù persistent connections with online devices. To learn more about the Zuul Push solution, listen to <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/ny2018/presentation/architectures-youve-always-wondered-about-presentation">this talk</a> from a Netflix colleague.</p><h4>Persistent Store</h4><p>A Cassandra database that stores all the notifications emitted by RENO for each device to allow those devices to poll for their messages at their own¬†cadence.</p><h3>Observability</h3><p>At Netflix, we put a strong emphasis on building robust monitoring into our systems to provide a clear view of system health. For a high RPS service like RENO that relies on several upstream systems as its traffic source and simultaneously produces heavy traffic for different internal and external downstream systems, it is important to have a strong combination of metrics, alerting and logging in place. For alerting, in addition to the standard system health metrics such as CPU, memory, and performance, we added a number of ‚Äúedge-of-the-service‚Äù metrics and logging to capture any aberrations from upstream or downstream systems. Furthermore, in addition to real-time alerting, we added trend analysis for important metrics to help catch longer term degradations. We instrumented RENO with a real time stream processing application called Mantis (you can learn more about it <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-mantis-a-platform-for-building-cost-effective-realtime-operations-focused-5b8ff387813a">here</a>). It allowed us to track events in real-time over the wire at device specific granularity thus making debugging easier. Finally, we found it useful to have platform-specific alerting (for iOS, Android, etc.) in finding the root causes of issues¬†faster.</p><h3>Wins</h3><ul><li>Can easily support new use¬†cases</li><li>Scales horizontally with higher throughput</li></ul><p>When we set out to build RENO the goal was limited to the ‚ÄúPersonalized Experience Refresh‚Äù use case of the product. As the design of RENO evolved, support for new use cases became possible and RENO was quickly positioned as the centralized rapid notification service for all product areas at¬†Netflix.</p><p>The design decisions we made early on paid off, such as making addition of new use cases a ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù solution and providing a hybrid delivery model across all platforms. We were able to onboard additional product use cases at a fast pace thus unblocking a lot of innovation.</p><p>An important learning in building this platform was ensuring that RENO could scale horizontally as more types of events and higher throughput was needed over time. This ability was primarily achieved by allowing sharding based on either event type or priority, along with using an asynchronous event driven processing model that can be scaled by simply adding more machines for event processing.</p><h3>Looking Ahead</h3><p>As Netflix‚Äôs member base continues to grow at a rapid pace, it is increasingly beneficial to have a service like RENO that helps give our members the best and most up to date Netflix experience. From membership related updates to contextual personalization, and more‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe are continually evolving our notifications portfolio as we continue to innovate on our member experience. Architecturally, we are evaluating opportunities to build in more features such as guaranteed message delivery and message batching that can open up more use cases and help reduce the communication footprint of¬†RENO.</p><h3>Building Great Things¬†Together</h3><p>We are just getting started on this journey to build impactful systems that help propel our business forward. The core to bringing these engineering solutions to life is our direct collaboration with our colleagues and using the most impactful tools and technologies available.

The design of a cron job is simple, you take some system command, you pick the schedule to run it on and you are done.¬†Example:</p><pre>0 0 * * MON /home/alice/backup.sh</pre><p>In the above example the system would wake up every Monday morning and execute the backup.sh script. Simple right? But what if the script does not exist in the given path, or what if it existed initially but then Alice let Bob access her home directory and he accidentally deleted it? Or what if Alice wanted to add new backup functionality and she accidentally broke existing code while updating¬†it?</p><p>The answers to these questions is something we would like to address in this article and propose a clean solution to this¬†problem.</p><p>Let‚Äôs define some requirements that we are interested in delivering to the Netflix data engineers or anyone who would like to schedule a workflow with some external assets in it. By external assets we simply mean some executable carrying the actual business logic of the job. It could be a JAR compiled from Scala, a Python script or module, or a simple SQL file. The important thing is that this business logic can be built in a separate repository and maintained independently from the workflow definition. Keeping all that in mind we would like to achieve the following properties for the whole workflow deployment:</p><ol><li><strong>Versioning</strong>: we want both the workflow definition and its assets to be versioned and we want the versions to be tied together in a clear¬†way.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: we want to know which version of an asset is running along with every workflow instance, so if there are any issues we can easily identify which version caused the problem and to which one we could revert, if necessary.</li><li><strong>ACID deployment</strong>: for every scheduler workflow definition change, we would like to have all the workflow assets bundled in an atomic, durable, isolated and consistent manner. This way, if necessary, all we need to know is which version of the workflow to roll back to, and the rest would be taken care of for¬†us.</li></ol><p>While all the above goals are our North Star, we also don‚Äôt want to negatively affect fast deployment, high availability and arbitrary life span of any deployed¬†asset.</p><h3>Previous solutions</h3><p>The basic approach to pulling down arbitrary workflow resources during workflow execution has been known to mankind since the invention of cron, and with the advent of ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù cloud storage systems like S3, this approach has served us for many years. Its apparent flexibility and convenience can often fool us into thinking that by simply replacing the asset in the S3 location we can, without any hassle, introduce changes to our business logic. This method often proves very troublesome especially if there is more than one engineer working on the same pipeline and they are not all aware of the other folks‚Äô ‚Äúdeployment process‚Äù.</p><p>The slightly improved approach is shown on the diagram¬†below.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/976/0*DwP-Z_4MrdAz5UTG" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Manually constructed continuous delivery¬†system.</figcaption></figure><p>In Figure 1, you can see an illustration of a typical deployment pipeline manually constructed by a user for an individual project. The continuous deployment tool submits a workflow definition with pointers to assets in fixed S3 locations. These assets are then separately deployed to these fixed locations. At runtime, the assets are retrieved from the defined locations in S3 and executed in the runtime container. Despite requiring users to construct the deployment pipeline manually, often by writing their own scripts from scratch, this design works and has been successfully used by many teams for years. That being said, it does have some drawbacks that are revealed as you try to add any amount of complexity to your deployment logic. Let‚Äôs discuss a few of¬†them.</p><h4><strong>Does not consider branch/PR deployments</strong></h4><p>In any production pipeline, you want the flexibility of having a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù alternative deployment logic. For example, you may want to build your Scala code and deploy it to an alternative location in S3 while pushing a sandbox version of your workflow that points to this alternative location. Something this simple gets very complicated very quickly and requires the user to consider a number of things. Where should this alternative location be in S3? Is a single location enough? How do you set up your deployment logic to know when to deploy the workflow to a test or dev environment? Answers to these questions often end up being more custom logic inside of the user‚Äôs deployment scripts.</p><h4><strong>Cannot rollback to previous workflow¬†versions</strong></h4><p>When you deploy a workflow, you really want it to encapsulate an atomic and idempotent unit of work. Part of the reason for that is the desire for the ability to rollback to a previous workflow version and knowing that it will always behave as it did in previous runs. There can be many reasons to rollback but the typical one is when you‚Äôve recognized a regression in a recent deployment that was not caught during testing. In the current design, reverting to a previous workflow definition in your scheduling system is not enough! You have to rebuild your assets from source and move them to your fixed S3 location that your workflow points to. To enable atomic rollbacks, you can add more custom logic to your deployment scripts to always deploy your assets to a new location and generate new pointers for your workflows to use, but that comes with higher complexity that often just doesn‚Äôt feel worth it. More commonly, teams will opt to do more testing to try and catch regressions before deploying to production and will accept the extra burden of rebuilding all of their workflow dependencies in the event of a regression.</p><h4><strong>Runtime dependency on user-managed cloud storage locations</strong></h4><p>At runtime, the container must reach out to a user-defined storage location to retrieve the assets required. This causes the user-managed storage system to be a critical runtime dependency. If we zoom out to look at an entire workflow management system, the runtime dependencies can become unwieldy if it relies on various storage systems that are arbitrarily defined by the workflow developers!</p><h3>Dataflow deployment with asset management</h3><p>In the attempt to deliver a simple and robust solution to the managed workflow deployments we created a command line utility called Dataflow. It is a Python based CLI + library that can be installed anywhere inside the Netflix environment. This utility can build and configure workflow definitions and their assets during testing and deployment. See below¬†diagram:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/968/0*l2pFeuXB6azOzen0" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong>. Dataflow asset management system.</figcaption></figure><p>In Figure 2, we show a variation of the typical manually constructed deployment pipeline. Every asset deployment is released to some newly calculated UUID. The workflow definition can then identify a specific asset by its UUID. Deploying the workflow to the scheduling system produces a ‚ÄúDeployment Bundle‚Äù. The bundle includes all of the assets that have been referenced by the workflow definition and the entire bundle is deployed to the scheduling system. At every scheduled runtime, the scheduling system can create an instance of your workflow without having to gather runtime dependencies from external¬†systems.</p><p>The asset management system that we‚Äôve created for Dataflow provides a strong abstraction over this deployment design. Deploying the asset, generating the UUID, and building the deployment bundle is all handled automatically by the Dataflow build logic. The user does not need to be aware of anything that‚Äôs happening on S3, nor that S3 is being used at all! Instead, the user is given a flexible UUID referencing system that‚Äôs layered on top of our scheduling system‚Äôs workflow DSL. Later in the article we‚Äôll cover this referencing system in some detail. But first, let‚Äôs look at an example of deploying an asset and a workflow.</p><h4>Deployment of an¬†asset</h4><p>Let‚Äôs walk through an example of a workflow asset build and deployment. Let‚Äôs assume we have a repository called <strong>stranger-data</strong> with the following structure:</p><pre>.<br>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataflow.yaml<br>‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyspark-workflow<br>‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.sch.yaml<br>‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello_world<br>‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...<br>‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py<br>‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scala-workflow<br>    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.gradle<br>    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.sch.yaml<br>    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src<br>    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main<br>    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...<br>    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test<br>        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...</pre><p>Let‚Äôs now use Dataflow command to see what project components are¬†visible:</p><pre>stranger-data$ <strong>dataflow project list</strong></pre><pre>Python Assets:<br> -&gt; ./pyspark-workflow/hello_world/setup.py<br>Summary: 1 found.</pre><pre>Gradle Assets:<br> -&gt; ./scala-workflow/build.gradle<br>Summary: 1 found.</pre><pre>Scheduler Workflows:<br> -&gt; ./scala-workflow/main.sch.yaml<br> -&gt; ./pyspark-workflow/main.sch.yaml<br>Summary: 2found.</pre><p>Before deploying the assets, and especially if we made any changes to them, we can run unit tests to make sure that we didn‚Äôt break anything.

A typical workflow definition, written in YAML, does not need any compilation before it is shipped to the Scheduler API, but Dataflow designates a special step called ‚Äúrendering‚Äù to substitute all of the Dataflow variables and build the final¬†version.</p><p>The above expression ${dataflow.jar.scala-workflow} means that the workflow will be rendered and deployed with the latest version of the scala-workflow JAR available at the time of the workflow deployment. It is possible that the JAR is built as part of the same repository in which case the new build of the JAR and a new version of the workflow may be coming from the same deployment. But the JAR may be built as part of a completely different project and in that case the testing and deployment of the new workflow version can be completely decoupled.</p><p>We showed above how one would request the latest asset version available during deployment, but with Dataflow asset management we can distinguish two more asset access patterns. An obvious next one is to specify it by all its attributes: asset type, asset namespace, git repo owner, git repo name, git branch name, commit hash and consecutive build number. There is one more extra method for a middle ground solution to pick a specific build for a given namespace and git branch, which can help during testing and development. All of this is part of the user-interface for determining how the deployment bundle will be created. See below diagram for a visual illustration.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/0*cC9kyLjonVmjSZdl" /><figcaption><strong>Figure 3</strong>. A closer at the Deployment Bundle</figcaption></figure><p>In short, using the above variables gives the user full flexibility and allows them to pick any <strong>version</strong> of any <strong>asset</strong> in any <strong>workflow.</strong></p><p>An example of the workflow deployment with the rendering step is shown¬†below:</p><pre>stranger-data$ <strong>dataflow project deploy</strong></pre><pre>...</pre><pre>Building Scheduler Workflows:<br> -&gt; ./scala-workflow/main.sch.yaml...

Notice the value of the script variable of the write job. In the original code says ${dataflow.jar.scala-workflow} and in the rendered version it is translated to a specific file¬†pointer:</p><pre>stranger-data$ <strong>cat ./scala-workflow/main.sch.yaml<br></strong>...<br>dag:<br> - ddl -&gt; write<br> - write -&gt; audit<br> - audit -&gt; publish<br>jobs:<br> - ddl: ...<br> - write:<br>     spark:<br>       script: <strong>s3://dataflow/jars/scala-workflow/user/stranger-data/master/39206ee8/1.jar<br>       </strong>class: com.netflix.spark.ExampleApp<br>       conf: ...<br>       params: ...<br> - audit: ...<br> - publish: ...<br>...</pre><h3>User perspective</h3><p>The Infrastructure DSE team at Netflix is responsible for providing insights into data that can help the Netflix platform and service scale in a secure and effective way. Our team members partner with business units like Platform, OpenConnect, InfoSec and engage in enterprise level initiatives on a regular¬†basis.</p><p>One side effect of such wide engagement is that over the years our repository evolved into a mono-repo with each module requiring a customized build, testing and deployment strategy packaged into a single Jenkins job. This setup required constant upkeep and also meant every time we had a build failure multiple people needed to spend a lot of time in communication to ensure they did not step on each¬†other.</p><p>Last quarter we decided to split the mono-repo into separate modules and adopt Dataflow as our asset orchestration tool. Post deployment, the team relies on Dataflow for automated execution of unit tests, management and deployment of workflow related¬†assets.</p><p>By the end of the migration process our Jenkins configuration went¬†from:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*84Syq7sY9PniGsWs" /><figcaption>Figure 4. Real example of a deployment script.</figcaption></figure><p>to:</p><pre>cd /dataflow_workspace<br>dataflow project deploy</pre><p>The simplicity of deployment enabled the team to focus on the problems they set out to solve while the branch based customization gave us the flexibility to be our most effective at solving¬†them.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>This new method available for Netflix data engineers makes workflow management easier, more transparent and more reliable. And while it remains fairly easy and safe to build your business logic code (in Scala, Python, etc) in the same repository as the workflow definition that invokes it, the new Dataflow versioned asset registry makes it easier yet to build that code completely independently and then reference it safely inside data pipelines in any other Netflix repository, thus enabling easy code sharing and¬†reuse.</p><p>One more aspect of data workflow development that gets enabled by this functionality is what we call branch-driven deployment. This approach enables multiple versions of your business logic and workflows to be running at the same time in the scheduler ecosystem, and makes it easy, not only for individual users to run isolated versions of the code during development, but also to define isolated staging environments through which the code can pass before it reaches the production stage. Obviously, in order for the workflows to be safely used in that configuration they must comply with a few simple rules with regards to the parametrization of their inputs and outputs, but let‚Äôs leave this subject for another blog¬†post.</p><h3>Credits</h3><p>Special thanks to Peter Volpe, Harrington Joseph and Daniel Watson for the initial design¬†review.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=86525b3e21ca" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/data-pipeline-asset-management-with-dataflow-86525b3e21ca">Data pipeline asset management with Dataflow</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

               <article><p><em>By Karen Casella, Director of Engineering, Access &amp; Identity Management</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*7zWnpCdZ_OTjyo-6" /></figure><p>Have you ever experienced one of the following scenarios while looking for your next¬†role?</p><ul><li>You study and practice coding interview problems for hours/days/weeks/months, only to be asked to merge two sorted¬†lists.</li><li>You apply for multiple roles at the same company and proceed through the interview process with each hiring team separately, despite the fact that there is tremendous overlap in the¬†roles.</li><li>You go through the interview process, do really well, get really excited about the company and the people you meet, and in the end, you are ‚Äúmatched‚Äù to a role that does not excite you, working with a manager and team you have not even met during the interview process.</li></ul><p>Interviewing can be a daunting endeavor and how companies, and teams, approach the process varies greatly. We hope that by demystifying the process, you will feel more informed and confident about your interview experience.</p><h3>Backend Engineering Interview Loop</h3><p>When you apply for a backend engineering role at Netflix, or if one of our recruiters or hiring managers find your LinkedIn profile interesting, a recruiter or hiring manager reviews your technical background and experience to see if your experience is aligned with our requirements. If so, we invite you to begin the interview process.</p><p>Most backend engineering teams follow a process very similar to what is shown below. While this is a relatively stream-lined process, it is not as efficient if a candidate is interested in or qualified for multiple roles within the organization.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/940/0*p0bYR_ImiRxFBYep" /></figure><p>Following is a brief description of each of these¬†stages.</p><p><strong>Recruiter Phone Screen: </strong>A member of our talent team contacts you to explain the process and to assess high-level qualifications¬†. The recruiter also reviews the relevant open roles to see if you have a strong affinity for one or another. If your interests and experience align well with one or more of the roles, they schedule a phone screen with one of the hiring managers.</p><p><strong>Manager Phone Screen: </strong>The purpose of this discussion is to get a sense for your technical background, your approach to problem solving, and how you work. It‚Äôs also a great opportunity for you to learn more about the available roles, the technical challenges the teams are facing and what it‚Äôs like to work on a backend engineering team at¬†Netflix.</p><p><strong>Technical Screen: </strong>The final screen before on-site interviews is used to assess your technical skills and match for the team. For many roles, you will be given a choice between a take-home coding exercise or a one-hour discussion with one of the engineers from the team. The problems you are asked to solve are related to the work of the¬†team.</p><p><strong>Round 1 Interviews: </strong>If you are invited on-site, the first round interview is with four or five people for 45 minutes each. The interview panel consists of two or three engineers, a hiring manager and a recruiter. The engineers assess your technical skills by asking you to solve various design and coding problems. These questions reflect actual challenges that our teams¬†face.</p><p><strong>Round 2 Interviews: </strong>You meet with two or three additional people, for 45 minutes each. The interview panel comprises an engineering director, a partner engineer or manager, and another engineering leader. The focus of this round is to assess how well you partner with other teams and your non-technical skills.</p><p><strong>Decision &amp; Offer: </strong>After round 2, we review the feedback and decide whether or not we will be offering you a role. If so, you will work with the recruiter to discuss compensation expectations, answer any questions that remain for you, and discuss a start date with your new¬†team.</p><h3>Enter Centralized Hiring</h3><p>Some Netflix backend engineering teams, seeking <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">stunning colleagues</a> with similar backgrounds and talents, are joining forces and adopting a centralized hiring model. <strong>Centralized hiring is an approach of making multiple hiring decisions through one unified hiring process across multiple teams with shared needs in skill, function and experience level.</strong></p><p>The interview approach does not vary much from what is shown above, with one big exception: <strong><em>there are several potential ‚Äúpivot points‚Äù where you and / or Netflix may decide to focus on a particular role based on your experience and preference. </em></strong>At each stage of the process, we consider your preference and skills and may focus your remaining interviews with a specific team if we both consider it a strong match. It‚Äôs important to note that, even though your experience may not be an exact match for one team, you might be more closely aligned with another team. In that case, we would pivot you to another team rather than disqualify you from the¬†process.</p><h3>Interview Tips</h3><p>Interviewing can be intimidating and stressful! Being prepared can help you minimize stress and anxiety. Following are a few quick tips to help you¬†prepare:</p><ul><li>Review your profile and make connections between your experience and the job description.</li><li>Think about your past work experiences and prepare some examples of when you achieved something amazing, or had some tough challenges.</li><li>We recommend against interview coding practice puzzle-type exercises, as we don‚Äôt ask those types of questions. If you want to practice, focus on medium-difficulty real-world problems you might encounter in a software engineering role.</li><li>Be sure to have questions prepared to ask the interviewers. This is a conversation, not an inquisition!</li></ul><p>We are here to accommodate any accessibility needs you may have, to ensure that you‚Äôre set up for success during your interview. Let us know if you need any assistive technology or other accommodations ahead of time, and we‚Äôll be sure to work with you to get it set¬†up.</p><p>We want to see you at your best‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe are not trying to trick you or trip you up! Try to relax, remember to breathe, and be honest and curious. <strong><em>Remember, this is not just about whether Netflix thinks you are a fit for the role, it‚Äôs about you deciding that Netflix and the role are right for¬†you!</em></strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*-3TCETA_eVvvl6ce" /></figure><h3>Yes, We Are¬†Hiring!</h3><p>Several of our backend engineering teams are searching for our next stunning colleagues.

Need to catch up? Earlier posts covered the basics of A/B tests (<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/decision-making-at-netflix-33065fa06481">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/what-is-an-a-b-test-b08cc1b57962">Part 2</a> ), core statistical concepts (<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/interpreting-a-b-test-results-false-positives-and-statistical-significance-c1522d0db27a">Part 3</a> and <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/interpreting-a-b-test-results-false-negatives-and-power-6943995cf3a8">Part 4</a>), how to build confidence in a decision (<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/building-confidence-in-a-decision-8705834e6fd8">Part 5</a>), and the the role of Experimentation and A/B testing within the larger Data Science and Engineering organization at Netflix (<a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/experimentation-is-a-major-focus-of-data-science-across-netflix-f67923f8e985">Part¬†6</a>).</blockquote><p>Earlier posts in this series covered the why, what and how of A/B testing, all of which are necessary to reap the benefits of experimentation for product development. But without a little magic, these basics are still not¬†enough.</p><p>The secret sauce that turns the raw ingredients of experimentation into supercharged product innovation is <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">culture</a>. There are never any shortcuts when developing and growing culture, and fostering a culture of experimentation is no exception. Building leadership buy-in for an approach to learning that emphasizes A/B testing, building trust in the results of tests, and building the technical capabilities to execute experiments at scale all take time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparticularly within an organization that‚Äôs new to these ideas. But the pay-offs of using experimentation and the virtuous cycle of product development via the scientific method are well worth the effort. Our colleagues at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/experimentation-platform-exp/">Microsoft</a> have shared thoughtful publications on how to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/experimentation-platform-exp/articles/it-takes-a-flywheel-to-fly-kickstarting-and-keeping-the-a-b-testing-momentum/">Kickstart the Experimentation Flywheel</a> and build a culture of experimentation, while their ‚Äú<a href="https://exp-platform.com/Documents/2017-05%20ICSE2017_EvolutionOfExP.pdf">Crawl, Walk, Run, Fly</a>‚Äù model is a great tool for assessing the maturity of an experimentation practice.</p><p>At Netflix, we‚Äôve been leveraging experimentation and the scientific method for decades, and are fortunate to have a mature experimentation culture. There is broad buy-in across the company, including from the C-Suite, that, whenever possible, results from A/B tests or other causal inference approaches are near-requirements for decision making. We‚Äôve also invested in education programs to up-level company-wide understanding of how we use A/B tests as a framework for product development. In fact, most of the material from this blog series has been adapted from our internal Experimentation 101 and 201 classes, which are open to anyone at¬†Netflix.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*9RDYcxBOXJ0o04Xb" /></figure><h4>Netflix is organized to¬†learn</h4><p>As a company, Netflix is organized to emphasize the importance of learning from data, including from A/B tests. Our Data and Insights organization has teams that partner with all corners of the company to deliver a better experience to our members, from understanding content preferences around the globe to delivering a seamless customer support experience. We use qualitative and quantitative consumer research, analytics, experimentation, predictive modeling, and other tools to develop a deep understanding of our members. And we own the data pipelines that power everything from executive-oriented dashboards to the personalization systems that help connect each Netflix member with content that will spark joy for them. This data-driven mindset is ubiquitous at all levels of the company, and the Data and Insights organization is represented at the highest echelon of <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/about-us">Netflix Leadership</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*4yLRW1wClPf3pvLo" /></figure><p>As discussed in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/experimentation-is-a-major-focus-of-data-science-across-netflix-f67923f8e985">Part 6</a>, there are experimentation and causal inference focussed data scientists who collaborate with product innovation teams across Netflix. These data scientists design and execute tests to support learning agendas and contribute to decision making. By diving deep into the details of single test results, looking for patterns across tests, and exploring other data sources, these Netflix data scientists build up domain expertise about aspects of the Netflix experience and become valued partners to product managers and engineering leaders. Data scientists help shape the evolution of the Netflix product through opportunity sizing and identifying areas ripe for innovation, and frequently propose hypotheses that are subsequently tested.</p><p>We‚Äôve also invested in a broad and flexible experimentation platform that allows our experimentation program to scale with the ambitions of the company to learn more and better serve Netflix members. Just as the Netflix product itself has evolved over the years, our approach to developing technologies to support experimentation at scale continues to evolve. In fact, we‚Äôve been working to improve experimentation platform solutions at Netflix for more than 20 years‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour first investments in tooling to support A/B tests came way back in¬†2001.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*01bdYWp3wc1lD5UK" /><figcaption>Early experimentation tooling developed by Stan Lanning at Netflix, in¬†2001.</figcaption></figure><h4>Learning and experimentation are ubiquitous across¬†Netflix</h4><p>Netflix has a unique internal <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">culture</a> that reinforces the use of experimentation and the scientific method as a means to deliver more joy to all of our current and future members. As a company, we aim to be curious, and to truly and honestly understand our members around the world, and how we can better entertain them. We are also open minded, knowing that great ideas can come from unlikely sources. There‚Äôs no better way to learn and make great decisions than to confirm or falsify ideas and hypotheses using the power of rigorous testing. Openly and candidly sharing test results allows everyone at Netflix to develop intuition about our members and ideas for how we can deliver an ever better experience to them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand then the virtuous cycle starts¬†again.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/593/0*f5PNP97wX4Ve3iva" /></figure><p>In fact, Netflix has so many tests running on the product at any given time that a member may be simultaneously allocated to several tests. There is not one Netflix product: at any given time, we are testing out a large number of product variants, always seeking to learn more about how we can deliver more joy to our current members and attract new members. Some tests, such as the Top 10 list, are easy for users to notice, while others, such as changes to the <a href="https://research.netflix.com/business-area/personalization-and-search">personalization and search systems</a> or how Netflix <a href="https://research.netflix.com/business-area/streaming">encodes and delivers streaming video</a>, are less¬†obvious.</p><p>At Netflix, we are not afraid to test boldly, and to challenge fundamental or long-held assumptions. The Top 10 list is a great example of both: it‚Äôs a large and noticeable change that surfaces a new type of evidence on the Netflix product. Large tests like this can open up whole new areas for innovation, and are actively socialized and debated within the company (see below). On the other end of the spectrum, we also run tests on much smaller scales in order to optimize every aspect of the product. A great example is the testing we do to find just the right text copy for every aspect of the product. By the numbers, we run far more of these smaller and less noticeable tests, and we invest in end-to-end infrastructure that simplifies their execution, allowing product teams to rapidly go from hypothesis to test to roll out of the winning experience. As an example, the <a href="https://netflixtechblog.medium.com/words-matter-testing-copy-with-shakespeare-5df48b38158a">Shakespeare project</a> provides an end-to-end solution for rapid text copy testing that integrates with the centralized Netflix experimentation platform. More generally, we are always on the lookout for new areas that can benefit from experimentation, or areas where additional methodology or tooling can produce new or faster learnings.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jcFgZaWzxOd7rfaZ" /></figure><h4>Debating tests and the importance of¬†humility</h4><p>Netflix has mature operating mechanisms to debate, make, and socialize product decisions. Netflix does not make decisions by committee or by seeking consensus. Instead, for every significant decision there is a single ‚Äú<a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">Informed Captain</a>‚Äù who is ultimately responsible for making a judgment call after digesting relevant data and input from colleagues (including dissenting perspectives). Wherever possible, A/B test results or causal inference studies are an expected input to this decision making¬†process.</p><p>In fact, not only are test results expected for product decisions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs expected that decisions on investment areas for innovation and testing, test plans for major innovations, and results of major tests are all summarized in memos, socialized broadly, and actively debated. The forums where these debates take place are broadly accessible, ensuring a diverse set of viewpoints provide feedback on test designs and results, and weigh in on decisions. Invites for these forums are open to anyone who is interested, and the price of admission is reading the memo. Despite strong executive attendance, there‚Äôs a notable lack of hierarchy in these forums, as we all seek to be led by the¬†data.</p><p>Netflix data scientists are active and valued participants in these forums. Data scientists are expected to speak for the data, both what can and what cannot be concluded from experimental results, the pros and cons of different experimental designs, and so forth. Although they are not informed captains on product decisions, data scientists, as interpreters of the data, are active contributors to key product decisions.</p><p>Product evolution via experimentation can be a humbling experience. At Netflix, we have experts in every discipline required to develop and evolve the Netflix service (product managers, UI/UX designers, data scientists, engineers of all types, experts in recommendation systems and streaming video optimization‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe list goes on), who are constantly coming up with novel hypotheses for how to improve Netflix. But only a small percentage of our ideas turn out to be winners in A/B tests. That‚Äôs right: despite our broad expertise, our members let us know, through their actions in A/B tests, that most of our ideas do not improve the service. We build and test hundreds of product variants each year, but only a small percentage end up in production and rolled out to the more than 200 million Netflix members around the¬†world.</p><p>The low win rate in our experimentation program is both humbling and empowering. It‚Äôs hard to maintain a big ego when anyone at the company can look at the data and see all the big ideas and investments that have ultimately not panned out. But nothing proves the value of decision making through experimentation like seeing ideas that all the experts were bullish on voted down by member actions in A/B tests‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand seeing a minor tweak to a sign up flow turn out to be a massive revenue generator.</p><p>At Netflix, we do not view tests that do not produce winning experience as ‚Äúfailures.‚Äù When our members vote down new product experiences with their actions, we still learn a lot about their preferences, what works (and does not work!) for different member cohorts, and where there may, or may not be, opportunities for innovation. Combining learnings from tests in a given innovation area, such as the Mobile UI experience, helps us paint a more complete picture of the types of experiences that do and do not resonate with our members, leading to new hypotheses, new tests, and, ultimately, a more joyful experience for our members. And as our member base continues to grow globally, and as consumer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, we also revisit ideas that were unsuccessful when originally tested. Sometimes there are signals from the original analysis that suggest now is a better time for that idea, or that it will provide value to some of our newer member¬†cohorts.</p><p>Because Netflix tests all ideas, and because most ideas are not winners, our culture of experimentation democratizes ideation. Product managers are always hungry for ideas, and are open to innovative suggestions coming from anyone in the company, regardless of seniority or expertise. After all, we‚Äôll test anything before rolling it out to the member base, and even the experts have low success rates! We‚Äôve seen time and time again at Netflix that product suggestions large and small that arise from engineers, data scientists, even our executives, can result in unexpected wins.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*TTvsbBXmg38pxteb" /><figcaption>(Left) Very few of our ideas are winners. (Right) Experimentation democratizes ideation. Because we test all ideas, and because most do not win, there‚Äôs an openness to product ideas coming from all corners of the business: anyone can raise their hand and make a suggestion.</figcaption></figure><p>A culture of experimentation allows more voices to contribute to ideation, and far, far more voices to help inform decision making. It‚Äôs a way to get the best ideas from everyone working on the product, and to ensure that the innovations that are rolled out are vetted and approved by¬†members.</p><p>A better product for our members and an internal culture that is humble and values ideas and evidence: experimentation is a win-win proposition for¬†Netflix.</p><h4>Emerging research¬†areas</h4><p>Although Netflix has been running experiments for decades, we‚Äôve only scratched the surface relative to what we want to learn and the capabilities we need to build to support those learning ambitions. There are open challenges and opportunities across experimentation and causal inference at Netflix: exploring and implementing new methodologies that allow us to learn faster and better; developing software solutions that support research; evolving our internal experimentation platform to better serve a growing user community and ever increasing size and throughput of experiments. And there‚Äôs a continuous focus on evolving and growing our experimentation culture through internal events and education programs, as well as external contributions. Here are a few themes that are on our¬†radar:</p><p><strong>Increasing velocity: beyond fixed time horizon experimentation.</strong></p><p>This series has focused on fixed time horizon tests: sample sizes, the proportion of traffic allocated to each treatment experience, and the test duration are all fixed in advance. In principle, the data are examined only once, at the conclusion of the test. This ensures that the false positive rate (see <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/interpreting-a-b-test-results-false-positives-and-statistical-significance-c1522d0db27a">Part 3</a>) is not increased by <a href="http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/KKD%202017/pdfs/p1517.pdf">peeking at the data numerous times</a>. In practice, we‚Äôd like to be able to call tests early, or to adapt how incoming traffic is allocated as we learn incrementally about which treatments are successful and which are not, in a way that preserves the statistical properties described earlier in this series. To enable these benefits, Netflix is investing in sequential experimentation that permits for valid decision making at any time, versus waiting until a fixed time has passed. These methods are already being used to ensure <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/safe-updates-of-client-applications-at-netflix-1d01c71a930c">safe deployment of Netflix client applications</a>. We are also investing in support for experimental designs that adaptively allocate traffic throughout the test towards promising treatments. The goal of both these efforts is the same: more rapid identification of experiences that benefit¬†members.</p><p><strong>Scaling support for quasi experimentation and causal inference.</strong></p><p>Netflix has learned an enormous amount, and dramatically improved almost every aspect of the product, using the classic online A/B tests, or randomized controlled trials, that have been the focus of this series. But not every business question is amenable to A/B testing, whether due to an inability to randomize at the individual level, or due to factors, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_(experiment)">spillover effects</a>, that may violate key assumptions for valid causal inference. In these instances, we often rely on the rigorous evaluation of quasi-experiments, where units are not assigned to a treatment or control condition by a random process. But the term ‚Äúquasi-experimentation‚Äù itself covers a broad category of experimental design and methodological approaches that differ between the myriad academic backgrounds represented by the Netflix data science community. How can we synthesize best practices across domains and scale our approach to enable more colleagues to leverage quasi-experimentation?</p><p>Our early successes in this space have been driven by investments in knowledge sharing across business verticals, education, and enablement via tooling. Because quasi-experiment use cases span many domains at Netflix, identifying common patterns has been a powerful driver in developing shared libraries that scientists can use to evaluate individual quasi-experiments. And to support our continued scale, we‚Äôve built internal tooling that coalesces data retrieval, design evaluation, analysis, and reproducible reporting, all with the goal to enable our scientists.</p><p>We expect our investments in research, tooling, and education for quasi-experiments to grow over time. In success, we will enable both scientists and their cross functional partners to learn more about how to deliver more joy to current and future Netflix¬†members.</p><p><strong>Experimentation Platform as a¬†Product</strong>.</p><p>We treat the Netflix Experimentation Platform as an internal product, complete with its own product manager and innovation roadmap. We aim to provide an end-to-end paved path for configuring, allocating, monitoring, reporting, storing and analyzing A/B tests, focusing on experimentation use cases that are optimized for simplicity and testing velocity. Our goal is to make experimentation a simple and integrated part of the product lifecycle, with little effort required on the part of engineers, data scientists, or PMs to create, analyze, and act on tests, with automation available wherever the test owner wants¬†it.</p><p>However, if the platform‚Äôs default paths don‚Äôt work for a specific use case, experimenters can leverage our <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/reimagining-experimentation-analysis-at-netflix-71356393af21">democratized contribution model</a>, or reuse pieces of the platform, to build out their own solutions. As experimenters innovate on the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in measurement methodology, experimental design, and automation, the Experimentation Platform team partners to commoditize these innovations and make them available to the broader organization.</p><p>Three core principles guide product development for our experimentation platform:</p><ul><li>Complexities and nuances of testing such as allocations and methodologies should, typically, be abstracted away from the process of running a single test, with emphasis instead placed on <strong>opinionated defaults that are sensible for a set of use cases or testing¬†areas.</strong></li><li>Manual intervention at specific steps in the test execution should, typically, be optional, with emphasis instead on test owners being able to<strong> invest their attention where they feel it adds value and leave other areas to automation</strong>.</li><li>Designing, executing, reporting, deciding, and learning are all different phases of the experiment lifecycle that have differing needs and users, and each stage benefits from <strong>purpose built tooling for each¬†use</strong>.</li></ul><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Netflix has a strong culture of experimentation, and results from A/B tests, or other applications of the scientific method, are generally expected to inform decisions about how to improve our product and deliver more joy to members. To support the current and future scale of experimentation required by the growing Netflix member base and the increasing complexity of our business, Netflix has invested in culture, people, infrastructure, and internal education to make A/B testing broadly accessible across the¬†company.</p><p>And we are continuing to evolve our culture of learning and experimentation to deliver more joy to Netflix members around the world. As our member base and business grows, smaller differences between treatment and control experiences become materially important. That‚Äôs also true for subsets of the population: with a growing member base, we can become more targeted and look to deliver positive experiences to cohorts of users, defined by geographical region, device type, etc. As our business grows and expands, we are looking for new places that could benefit from experimentation, ways to run more experiments and learn more with each, and ways to accelerate our experimentation program while making experimentation accessible to more of our colleagues.</p><p>But the biggest opportunity is to deliver more joy to our members through the virtuous cycle of experimentation.</p><p>Interested in learning more?

               <article><p><a href="https://twitter.com/angustweets"><em>Angus Croll</em></a></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*admHu1DuoaSrYF3Sx3_n9w.png" /></figure><p>Netflix is used by 222 million members and runs on over 1700 device types ranging from state-of-the-art smart TVs to low-cost mobile¬†devices.</p><p>At Netflix we‚Äôre <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787426/netflix-cdn-open-connect">proud of our reliability</a> and we want to keep it that way. To that end, it‚Äôs important that we prevent significant performance regressions from reaching the production app. Sluggish scrolling or late rendering is frustrating and triggers accidental navigations. Choppy playback makes watching a show less enjoyable. Any performance regression that makes it into a product release will degrade user experience, so the challenge is to detect and fix such regressions before they¬†ship.</p><p>This post describes how the Netflix TVUI team implemented a robust strategy to quickly and easily detect performance anomalies before they are released‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand often before they are even committed to the codebase.</p><h3>What do we mean by Performance?</h3><p>Technically, ‚Äúperformance‚Äù metrics are those relating to the responsiveness or latency of the app, including start up¬†time.</p><p>But TV devices also tend to be more memory constrained than other devices, and as such are more liable to crash during a memory spike‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso for Netflix TV we actually care about memory at least as much as performance, maybe more¬†so.</p><p>At Netflix the term ‚Äúperformance‚Äù usually encompasses both performance metrics (in the strict meaning) and memory metrics, and that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre using the term¬†here.</p><h3>Why do we run Performance Tests on¬†commits?</h3><p>It‚Äôs harder to reason about the performance profile of pre-production code since we can‚Äôt gather real-time metrics for code that hasn‚Äôt yet shipped. We do cut a canary release in advance of shipment which is dogfooded by Netflix employees and subject to the same metrics collection as the production release. While the canary release is a useful dry-run for pending shipments, it sometimes misses regressions because the canary user base is a fraction of the production release. And in the event that regressions are detected in the canary, it still necessitates an often messy and time consuming revert or¬†patch.</p><p>By running performance tests against every commit (pre- and post-merge), we can detect potentially regressive commits earlier. The sooner we detect such commits the fewer subsequent builds are affected and the easier it is to revert. Ideally we catch regressions before they even reach the main¬†branch.</p><h3>What are the Performance Tests?</h3><p>The goal of our TVUI Performance Tests is to gather memory and responsiveness metrics while simulating the full range of member interactions with Netflix¬†TV.</p><p>There are roughly 50 performance tests, each one designed to reproduce an aspect of member engagement. The goal is to keep each test brief and focused on a specific, isolated piece of functionality (startup, profile switching, scrolling through titles, selecting an episode, playback etc.), while the test suite as a whole should cover the entire member experience with minimal duplication. In this way we can run multiple tests in parallel and the absence of long pole tests keeps the overall test time manageable and allows for repeat test runs. Every test runs on a combination of devices (physical and virtual) and platform versions (<em>SDKs</em>). We‚Äôll refer to each unique test/device/SDK combination as a <em>test variation</em>.</p><p>We run the full performance suite twice per Pull Request¬†(PR):</p><ul><li>when the PR is first submitted</li><li>when the PR is merged to the destination branch</li></ul><h4>Measurement</h4><p>Each performance test tracks either memory or responsiveness. Both of these metrics will fluctuate over the course of a test, so we post metric values at regular intervals throughout the test. To compare test runs we need a method to consolidate this range of observed values into a single¬†value.</p><p>We made the following decisions:</p><p><strong>Memory Tests:</strong> use the maximum memory value observed during the test run (because that‚Äôs the value that determines whether a device could¬†crash).</p><p><strong>Responsiveness Tests¬†:</strong> use the median value observed during the test run (based on the assumption that perceived slowness is influenced by all responses, not just the worst response).</p><h3>What are the Challenges?</h3><p>When Netflix is running in production, we capture real-time performance data which makes it relatively easy to make assertions about the app‚Äôs performance. It‚Äôs much harder to assess the performance of pre-production code (changes merged to the main branch but not yet released) and harder still to get a performance signal for unmerged code in a PR. Performance test metrics are inferior to real-time usage metrics for several¬†reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Data volume:</strong> In the Netflix app, the same steps are repeated billions of times, but developer velocity and resource constraints dictate that performance tests can only run a handful of times per¬†build.</li><li><strong>Simulation: </strong>No matter how rigorous or creative our testing process is, we can only ever approximate the experience of real life users, never replicate it. Real users regularly use Netflix for hours at a time, and every user has different preferences and¬†habits.</li><li><strong>Noise: </strong>Ideally a given codebase running any given test variation will always return identical results. In reality that just never happens: no two device CPUs are identical, garbage collection is not entirely predictable, API request volume and backend activity is variable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso are power levels and network bandwidth. For every test there will be background noise that we need to somehow filter from our analysis.</li></ul><h3>Initial Approach: Static Thresholds</h3><p>For our first attempt at performance validation we assigned maximum acceptable threshold values for memory metrics. There was a sound rationale behind this approach‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen a TV runs Netflix there is a hard limit for memory footprint beyond which Netflix has the potential to¬†crash.</p><p>There were several issues with the static thresholds approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Custom preparation work per test:</strong> Since each test variation has a unique memory profile, the appropriate static threshold had to be researched and assigned on a case-by-case basis. This was difficult and time consuming, so we only assigned thresholds to about 30% of test variations.</li><li><strong>Lack of context:</strong> As a validation technique, static thresholds proved to be somewhat arbitrary. Imagine a commit that increases memory usage by 10% but to a level which is just below the threshold. The next commit might be a README change (zero memory impact) but due to normal variations in device background noise, the metric could increase by just enough to breach the threshold.</li><li><strong>Background variance is not filtered:</strong> Once the codebase is bumping against the memory threshold, background device noise becomes the principal factor determining which side of the threshold line the test result¬†falls.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jQil7x0BaYT7AP4u" /><figcaption>Unreliable regression signals with static Threshold technique</figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Post-alert adjustments:</strong> We found ourselves repeatedly increasing the thresholds to move them clear of background noise</li></ul><h3>The Pivot: Anomaly and Changepoint Detection</h3><p>It became apparent we needed a technique for performance validation that:</p><ul><li><strong>Removes failure bias</strong> by giving equal weight to all test runs, regardless of¬†results</li><li><strong>Doesn‚Äôt treat performance data points in isolation</strong>, but instead assesses the performance impact of a build in relation to previous¬†builds.</li><li><strong>Can be automatically applied to every test</strong> without the need for pre-hoc research, data entry or ongoing manual intervention</li><li><strong>Could be equally applied to test data of any type</strong>: memory, responsiveness, or any other non-boolean test¬†data</li><li><strong>Minimizes the impact of background noise</strong> by prioritizing variance over absolute¬†values</li><li><strong>Improves insight</strong> by examining data points both at the time of creation and retroactively</li></ul><p>We settled on a two-pronged approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> immediately calls out potential performance regressions by comparing with recent past¬†data</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pzAyf5-vFdvq2zKBL0Alww.png" /></figure><ul><li><strong>Changepoint Detection</strong> identifies more subtle performance inflections by examining past and future data¬†clusters</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SjQL33XX-6kGvbwcduZ8vQ.png" /></figure><h4>Anomaly Detection</h4><p>We define an anomaly as any metric data point that is more than <em>n</em> standard deviations above the recent mean, where recent mean and standard deviation are derived from the previous <em>m</em> test runs. For Netflix TV performance tests we currently set <em>n</em> to 4 and <em>m</em> to 40 but these values can be tweaked to maximize signal to noise ratio. When an anomaly is detected the test status is set to <em>failed</em> and an alert is generated.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1014/0*tnM3kpWhVJIVGEDI" /></figure><p>Anomaly detection works because thresholds are dynamic and derived from existing data. If the data exhibits a lot of background variance then the anomaly threshold will increase to account for the extra¬†noise.</p><h4>Changepoints</h4><p>Changepoints are data points at the boundary of two distinct data distribution patterns. We use a technique called <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4933.pdf">e-divisive</a> to analyze the 100 most recent test runs, using a Python implementation based on <a href="https://github.com/mongodb/signal-processing-algorithms/blob/master/src/signal_processing_algorithms/energy_statistics/energy_statistics.py#L222">this implementation</a>.</p><p>Since we‚Äôre only interested in performance regressions, we ignore changepoints that trend lower. When a changepoint is detected for a test, we don‚Äôt fail the test or generate an alert (we consider changepoints to be warnings of unusual patterns, not full blown error assertions).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/0*qemS91n-I1HK1Jmx" /></figure><p>As you can see, changepoints are a more subtle signal. They don‚Äôt necessarily indicate a regression but they suggest builds that had an impact on subsequent data distribution.</p><p>Builds that generate changepoints across multiple tests, warrant further investigation before they can be included in the release candidate.</p><p>Changepoints give us more confidence in regression detection because they disregard false positives such as one time data spikes. Because changepoint detection requires after-the-fact data, they are best suited to identifying potentially regressive code that is already in the main branch but has not yet been¬†shipped.</p><h3>Additional Adjustments</h3><h4>Runs per¬†Test</h4><p>To address failure bias, we decided to run all tests 3 times, regardless of the result. We chose 3 iterations to provide enough data to eliminate most device noise (tests are allocated to devices randomly) without creating a productivity bottleneck.</p><h4>Summarizing across Test¬†Runs</h4><p>Next we needed to decide on a methodology to compress the results of each batch of 3 runs into a single value. The goal was to ignore outlier results caused by erratic device behavior.</p><p>Initially we took the average of those three runs, but that led to an excess of false positives because the most irregular test runs exerted too much influence on the result. Switching to the median eliminated some of these false positives but we were still getting an unacceptable number of excess alerts (because during periods of high device noise we would occasionally see outlier results two times out of three). Finally, since we noticed that outlier results tended to be higher than normal‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärarely lower‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe settled on using the minimum value across the 3 runs and this proved to be the most effective at eliminating external¬†noise.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*T1AC7tPkjiPL75XR" /><figcaption><em>All data points (3 runs per¬†build)</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*jtRkrq8wVNRBo8Ow" /><figcaption><em>Selecting median value per¬†build</em></figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*hoDXBhioBVBsu72Z" /><figcaption><em>Selecting minimum value per¬†build</em></figcaption></figure><h3>What were the¬†Results?</h3><p>After switching our performance validation to use anomaly and changepoint detection we noticed several improvements.</p><p>a) We are alerted for potential performance regressions far less often, and when we do get alerted it‚Äôs much more likely to indicate a genuine regression. Our workload is further reduced by no longer having to manually increment static performance thresholds after each false positive.</p><p>The following table represents the alert summary for two distinct months last year. In March 2021 we still used static thresholds for regression alerts. By October 2021 we had switched using anomaly detection for regression alerts. <em>Alerts which were true regressions</em> is the number of alerted commits for which the suspected regression turned out to be both significant and persistent.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XE2q95DThkwuVxuJqzlzNA.png" /></figure><p>Note that since the March tests only validated when a threshold was manually set, the total number of validating test runs in October was much greater, and yet we still got only 10% of the¬†alerts.</p><p>b) We are not alerted for subsequent innocuous builds that inherit regressive commits from preceding builds. (Using the static threshold technique, all subsequent builds were alerted until the regressive build was reverted.) This is because regressive builds increase both mean and standard deviation and thus put subsequent non-regressing builds comfortably below the alert threshold.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1kQNvfzf_S5YxZCyMtfoHw.png" /><figcaption>Regressive build is above alert threshold</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*KbtqhnHNOjpDmD5N5WPDPg.png" /><figcaption>Subsequent build is easily below alert threshold</figcaption></figure><p>c) Performance tests against PRs, which had been almost constantly red (because the probability of at least one static threshold being breached was always high), are now mostly green.

It would be helpful to summarize external changes in our alert summaries.</li><li><strong>Factor out resolved regressions when determining baselines for validation:</strong> <br>When generating recent mean and standard deviation values, we could improve regression detection by filtering out data from erstwhile regressions that have since been¬†fixed.</li><li><strong>Improve Developer Velocity:</strong> We can further reduce total test time by removing unnecessary iterations within tests, adding more devices to ensure availability, and de-emphasizing testing for those parts of the app where performance is less likely to be critical. We can also pre-build app bundles (at least partially) so that the test suite is not delayed by waiting for fresh¬†builds.</li><li><strong>More closely mirror metrics gathered by the production app:</strong> In the deployed Netflix TV app we collect additional metrics such as TTR (time to render) and empty box rate (how frequently titles in the viewport are missing images). While test metrics and metrics collected during real use do not lend themselves to direct comparison, measuring the relative change in metrics in pre-production builds can help us to anticipate regressions in production.</li></ul><h4>Wider Adoption and New Use¬†Cases</h4><p>At this point Anomaly and Changepoint detection is applied to every commit in the TVUI repo, and is in the process of being deployed for commits to the TV Player repo (the layer that manages playback operations). Other Netflix teams (outside of the TV platform) have also expressed interest in these techniques and the ultimate goal is to standardize regression detection across¬†Netflix.</p><p>Anomaly and changepoint detection are entirely framework independent‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe only required inputs are a current value and an array of recent values to compare it to. As such, their utility extends far beyond performance tests. For example, we are considering using these techniques to monitor the reliability of non-performance-based test suites‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin this case the metric of interest is the percent of tests that ran to completion.</p><p>In the future we plan to decouple anomaly and changepoint logic from our test infrastructure and offer it as a standalone open-source library.</p><h3>Wrap Up</h3><p>By using techniques that assess the performance impact of a build in relation to the performance characteristics (magnitude, variance, trend) of adjacent builds, we can more confidently distinguish genuine regressions from metrics that are elevated for other reasons (e.g. inherited code, regressions in previous builds or one-off data spikes due to test irregularities). We also spend less time chasing false negatives and no longer need to manually assign a threshold to each result‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe data itself now sets the thresholds dynamically.</p><p>This improved efficiency and higher confidence level helps us to quickly identify and fix regressions before they reach our¬†members.</p><p>The anomaly and changepoint techniques discussed here can be used to identify regressions (or progressions), unexpected values or inflection points in any chronologically sequenced, quantitative data. Their utility extends well beyond performance analysis. For example they could be used to identify inflection points in system reliability, customer satisfaction, product usage, download volume or¬†revenue.</p><p>We encourage you to try these techniques on your own data. We‚Äôd love to learn more about their success (or otherwise) in other contexts!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=eab2602b86fe" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/fixing-performance-regressions-before-they-happen-eab2602b86fe">Fixing Performance Regressions Before they Happen</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

               <article><p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikram-srivastava-8641ba6/"><em>Vikram Srivastava</em></a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayworm/"><em>Marcelo¬†Mayworm</em></a></p><p>Netflix has one of the most complex data platforms in the cloud on which our data scientists and engineers run batch and streaming workloads. As our subscribers grow worldwide and <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile">Netflix enters the world of gaming</a>, the number of batch workflows and real-time data pipelines increases rapidly. The data platform is built on top of several distributed systems, and due to the inherent nature of these systems, it is inevitable that these workloads run into failures periodically. Troubleshooting these problems is not a trivial task and requires collecting logs and metrics from several different systems and analyzing them to identify the root cause. At our scale, even a tiny percentage of disrupted workloads can generate a substantial operational support burden for the data platform team when troubleshooting involves manual steps. And we can‚Äôt discount the productivity impact it causes on data platform¬†users.</p><p>It motivates us to be proactive in detecting and handling failed workloads in our production environment, avoiding interruptions that could slow down our teams. We have been working on an auto-diagnosis and remediation system called Pensive in the data platform to address these concerns. With the goal of troubleshooting failing and slow workloads and remediating them without human intervention wherever possible. As our platform continues to grow and different scenarios and issues can disrupt the workloads, Pensive has to be proactive in detecting broad problems at the platform level in real-time and diagnosing the impact across the workloads.</p><p>Pensive infrastructure comprises two separate systems to support batch and streaming workloads. This blog will explore these two systems and how they perform auto-diagnosis and remediation across our Big Data Platform and Real-time infrastructure.</p><h3>Batch Pensive</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/923/1*z8vQdetF-jacpT0iqhW_Gg.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>Batch Pensive Architecture</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Batch workflows in the data platform run using a <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6">Scheduler</a> service that launches containers on the Netflix container management platform called <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/titus-the-netflix-container-management-platform-is-now-open-source-f868c9fb5436">Titus</a> to run workflow steps. These steps launch jobs on clusters running Apache Spark and TrinoDb via <a href="https://netflix.github.io/genie/">Genie</a>. If a workflow step fails, Scheduler asks Pensive to diagnose the step‚Äôs error. Pensive collects logs for the failed jobs launched by the step from the relevant data platform components and then extracts the stack traces. Pensive relies on a regular expression based rules engine that has been curated over time. The rules encode information about whether an error is due to a platform issue or a user bug and whether the error is transient or not. If a regular expression from one of the rules matches, then Pensive returns information about that error to the Scheduler. If the error is transient, Scheduler will retry that step with exponential backoff a few more¬†times.</p><p>The most critical part of Pensive is the set of rules used to classify an error. We need to evolve them as the platform evolves to ensure that the percentage of errors that Pensive cannot classify remains low. Initially, the rules were added on an ad-hoc basis as requests came in from platform component owners and users. We have now moved to a more systematic approach where unknown errors are fed into a Machine Learning process that performs clustering to propose new regular expressions for commonly occurring errors. We take the proposals to platform component owners to then come up with the classification of the error source and whether it is of transitory nature. In the future, we are looking to automate this¬†process.</p><h4>Detection of Platform-wide Issues</h4><p>Pensive does error classification on individual workflow step failures, but by doing real-time analytics on the errors detected by Pensive using Apache Kafka and Apache Druid, we can quickly identify platform issues affecting many workflows. Once the individual diagnoses get stored in a Druid table, our monitoring and alerting system called <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-atlas-netflixs-primary-telemetry-platform-bd31f4d8ed9a">Atlas</a> does aggregations every minute and sends out alerts if there is a sudden increase in the number of failures due to platform errors. This has led to a dramatic reduction in the time it takes to detect issues in hardware or bugs in recently rolled out data platform software.</p><h3>Streaming Pensive</h3><figure><img alt="Streaming Pensive Architecture" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Qw07CY3mlmfcI70UFZv0GQ.jpeg" /><figcaption><strong>Streaming Pensive Architecture</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Apache Flink powers real-time stream processing jobs in the Netflix data platform. And most of the Flink jobs run under a managed platform called <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/keystone-real-time-stream-processing-platform-a3ee651812a">Keystone</a>, which abstracts out the underlying Flink job details and allows users to consume data from Apache Kafka streams and publish them to different data stores like Elasticsearch and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/iceberg">Apache Iceberg</a> on AWS¬†S3.</p><p>Since the data platform manages keystone pipelines, users expect platform issues to be detected and remediated by the Keystone team without any involvement from their end. Furthermore, data in Kafka streams have a finite retention period, which adds time pressure for resolving the issues to avoid data¬†loss.</p><p>For every Flink job running as part of a Keystone pipeline, we monitor the metric indicating how far the Flink consumer lags behind the Kafka producer. If it crosses a threshold, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-atlas-netflixs-primary-telemetry-platform-bd31f4d8ed9a">Atlas</a> sends a notification to Streaming Pensive.</p><p>Like its batch counterpart, Streaming Pensive also has a rules engine to diagnose errors. However, in addition to logs, Streaming Pensive also has rules for checking various metric values for multiple components in the Keystone pipeline. The issue may occur in the source Kafka stream, the main Flink job, or the sinks to which the Flink job is writing data. Streaming Pensive diagnoses it and tries to remediate the issue automatically when it happens. Some examples where we are able to auto-remediate are:</p><ul><li>If Streaming Pensive finds that one or more Flink Task Managers are going out of memory, it can redeploy the Flink cluster with more Task Managers.</li><li>If Streaming Pensive finds that there is an unexpected increase in the rate of incoming messages on the source Kafka cluster, it can increase the topic retention size and period so that we don‚Äôt lose any data while the consumer is lagging. If the spike goes away after some time, Streaming Pensive can revert the retention changes. Otherwise, it will page the job owner to investigate if there is a bug causing the increased rate or if the consumers need to be reconfigured to handle the higher¬†rate.</li></ul><p>Even though we have a high success rate, there are still occasions where automation is not possible. If manual intervention is required, Streaming Pensive will page the relevant component team to take timely action to resolve the¬†issue.</p><h3>What‚Äôs Next?</h3><p>Pensive has had a significant impact on the operability of the Netflix data platform. And helped engineering teams lower the burden of operations work, freeing them to tackle more critical and challenging problems. But our job is nowhere near done. We have a long roadmap ahead of us. Some of the features and expansions we have planned¬†are:</p><ul><li>Batch Pensive is currently diagnosing failed jobs only, and we want to increase the scope into optimization to determine why jobs have become¬†slow.</li><li>Auto-configure batch workflows so that they finish successfully or become faster and use fewer resources when possible. One example where it can dramatically help is Spark jobs, where memory tuning is a significant challenge.</li><li>Expand Pensive with Machine Learning classifiers.</li><li>The streaming platform recently added <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/data-movement-in-netflix-studio-via-data-mesh-3fddcceb1059">Data Mesh</a>, and we need to expand Streaming Pensive to cover¬†that.</li></ul><h3>Acknowledgments</h3><p>This work could not have been completed without the help of the Big Data Compute and the Real-time Data Infrastructure teams within the Netflix data platform. They have been great partners for us as we work on improving the Pensive infrastructure.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5bcc52d853d1" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/auto-diagnosis-and-remediation-in-netflix-data-platform-5bcc52d853d1">Auto-Diagnosis and Remediation in Netflix Data Platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com">Netflix TechBlog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p></article>

Two NASA Satellites Lost</a> </summary>
               <article>"All appeared to be going smoothly," reports CBS News, "when, about a minute before
                  the second stage engine was expected to shut down, an onboard 'rocketcam' showed a
                  flash in the engine's exhaust plume. 
                  
                  "The camera view them showed what appeared to be a tumble before video from the rocket
                  cut off...."
                  
                  California-based Astra on Sunday launched two shoebox-size NASA satellites from Cape
                  Canaveral in a modest mission to improve hurricane forecasts, but the second stage
                  of the company's low-cost booster malfunctioned before reaching orbit and the payloads
                  were lost. 
                  
                  "The upper stage shut down early and we did not deliver the payloads to orbit," Astra
                  tweeted. "We have shared our regrets with @NASA and the payload team. More information
                  will be provided after we complete a full data analysis." 
                  
                  It was the seventh launch of Astra's small "Venture-class" rocket and the company's
                  fifth failure. Sunday's launch was the first of three planned for NASA to launch six
                  small CubeSats, two at a time, into three orbital planes. Given the somewhat risky
                  nature of relying on tiny shoebox-size CubeSats and a rocket with a very short track
                  record, the $40 million project requires just four satellites and two successful launches
                  to meet mission objectives. The NASA contract calls for the final two flights by the
                  end of July. Whether Astra can meet that schedule given Sunday's failure is not yet
                  known. 
                  
                  "Although today's launch with @Astra did not go as planned, the mission offered a
                  great opportunity for new science and launch capabilities," tweeted NASA science chief
                  Thomas Zurbuchen....
                  After Sunday's failure, he tweeted: "Even though we are disappointed right now, we
                  know: There is value in taking risks in our overall NASA Science portfolio because
                  innovation is required for us to lead."

               <article>The New York Times tells the story of crop circles, "the mysterious patterns that
                  regularly intrigued people around the world in the 1980s and '90s, prompting speculation
                  about alien visitors, ancient spiritual forces, weather anomalies, secret weapons
                  tests and other theories." 
                  
                  They call the phenomenon "a reminder that even before the era of social media and
                  the internet, hoaxes were able to spread virally around the world and true believers
                  could cling stubbornly to conspiracy theories despite a lack of evidence &amp;mdash; or
                  even the existence of evidence to the contrary."
                  
                  In the case of crop circles, the most important contradictory evidence emerged on
                  Sept. 9, 1991, when the British newspaper Today ran a front-page story under the headline
                  "Men who conned the world," revealing that two mischievous friends from Southampton
                  had secretly made more than 200 of the patterns over the previous decade. 
                  
                  Doug Bower, then 67, and his friend Dave Chorley, 62, admitted to a reporter, Graham
                  Brough, that in the late 1970s they had begun using planks of wood with ropes attached
                  to each end to stamp circles in crops by holding the ropes in their hands and pressing
                  the planks underfoot. They had then watched with amusement as their anonymous antics
                  eventually attracted media attention and began being copied by imitators around the
                  world... The real-life pranksters phoned the newspaper to come clean, according to
                  Mr. Brough, now 62, who says he verified their claims by checking an archive of more
                  than 200 crop circle designs stored in a shed behind Mr. Bower's home. The designs
                  were clearly aged and matched the patterns they had made over the years, Mr. Brough
                  said. 
                  
                  "I spent a week getting them to show me how they had done it all, and I have never
                  laughed as much in my life," he recalled. "The prevailing wisdom at the time was that
                  aliens were about to land any day, but it had all been kicked off by these two blokes
                  who'd have a couple of pints at their favorite pub and then head out into the night
                  to have a bit of fun...." 
                  
                  "The people who wanted to keep believing in aliens and everything else just ignored
                  the evidence, no matter how obvious it was," said Rob Irving, who had begun emulating
                  the two pranksters' work in 1989 and befriended them after they went public.... "The
                  power of the art came from the mystery, and Doug forever regretted coming forward
                  because the mystery was lost." 
                  
                  A professor of psychology at the University of Bristol in Britain explains to the
                  Times the thought process of believers (which he says predated the internet). "instead
                  of admitting that we live in a world we can't control, they take comfort from believing
                  that there is agency involved and someone who can be blamed." The Times finds an example
                  in a crop circle proponent who now believes, to this day, that even if crop circles
                  are all man-made, the people making them have unwittingly "been prompted by an independent
                  nonhuman mind." 
                  
                  Although after a new crop circle appeared, the Times obtained an alternative perspective
                  &amp;mdash; from a neighboring farmer. "It is just so irresponsible to be trespassing
                  and destroying food in the middle of a global wheat shortage."

               <article>Disneyland's Galaxy's Edge, aka "Star Wars Land," lets its visitors "immersively"
                  experience the planet Batuu during the period between Star Wars: Episode VIII &amp;mdash;
                  The Last Jedi and Episode IX &amp;mdash; The Rise of Skywalker. But there's some big changes
                  coming, reports SFGate.com:
                  
                  Disney recently announced &amp;mdash; at the "From a Galaxy Far, Far Away to Disney Park
                  Near You" panel at Star Wars Celebration Anaheim 2022 event &amp;mdash; that main characters
                  from the immensely popular Disney Plus series "The Book of Boba Fett" and "The Mandalorian"
                  would begin appearing at Disneyland. 
                  
                  Yes, including the universally adored, merchandise and meme-dominating Grogu, aka
                  "Baby Yoda." 
                  
                  However, there is one sarlacc-sized snag: Those stories are set about five years after
                  Return of the Jedi, and about 25 years before The Force Awakens, which raises a galaxy
                  of questions about how this will impact Galaxy's Edge. The introduction of new characters
                  into the attraction will either break the timeline of Star Wars land or, perhaps,
                  unburden it from self-imposed shackles.
                  
                  This could be a good thing, the article suggests, since "Currently there is frankly
                  not a lot of character interaction on Batuu."
                  Kylo Ren pops in on occasion to interrogate guests, and some stormtroopers march around.
                  Rey and Chewie pose for pics, R2-D2 wheels around, and Vi randomly shows up. But that's
                  about it. There is no BB-8 or C-3PO, no Poe or Finn walking around, no Captain Phasma
                  (who died in "The Last Jedi"). The cast members do their part to speak the local lingo
                  of "bright suns" and "till the spire," but Black Spire Outpost feels somewhat unpopulated.
                  It looks and feels like a Star Wars town, but lacks true full immersion. Oga's Cantina
                  does feel lived in, and always crowded, but the closest immersive experience is Savi's
                  Workshop, where building a lightsaber is a damn near religious experience, complete
                  with the Force ghost voice of Yoda. 
                  
                  So how would new characters impact this? If Mando appears at Galaxy's Edge, are guests
                  to assume he (and Grogu) are still bouncing about by the time of the sequel series...?
                  The town of Black Spire Outpost might come to resemble Fantasyland, for instance,
                  where multiple characters occupy their own zones and don't intersect... 
                  
                  Regardless, this change further populates Galaxy's Edge, which is good for the guest
                  who wants to take a lot of character photos. It also allows Disney to roll out their
                  most popular modern characters, and potentially open the door for them to showcase
                  original trilogy and prequel trilogy characters (which are having a moment right now).
                  
                  But it does create major story hiccups.

               <article>It's Warren Buffett versus Google, Facebook and Microsoft, according to a recent article
                  by Bloomberg. (Alternate URL here.)
                  
                  Google, Facebook and Microsoft Corp. &amp;mdash; three of the world's biggest corporate
                  buyers of clean power &amp;mdash; are sounding the alarm that a nearly $4-billion, Warren
                  Buffett-backed renewable-energy project proposed in Iowa isn't necessarily in the
                  best interest of customers, including them. 
                  
                  If approved, it would be the largest complex of wind farms in the entire country when
                  it comes online by the end of 2024, producing enough electricity for more than 700,000
                  homes. MidAmerican Energy, a utility owned by Buffett conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway
                  Inc., has asked state regulators to approve terms including a guaranteed 11.25% rate
                  of return before starting construction on a project it says will help in its efforts
                  to trim carbon emissions by 75% compared to 2005 levels. But the big-name tech giants
                  that operate data centers in the state warn the project, dubbed Wind Prime, could
                  drive up electricity costs. MidAmerican, they say, should consider alternatives....
                  
                  
                  
                  The fight is an important one to watch because it demonstrates the increasing influence
                  technology giants have on the energy transition. Tech companies have pushed utilities
                  in other parts of the U.S. to offer more clean energy options as they seek to clean
                  up the sources of power for their energy-intensive operations. And since they buy
                  so much power, the utilities often listen to them.... 
                  
                  Facebook, which also buys large amounts of power to run data centers in Iowa, referred
                  to the proposed project in a joint regulatory filing with Google as an "exceedingly
                  costly, massive increase in generation that MidAmerican has not demonstrated is necessary."
                  Last month, Microsoft filed its own petition with the Iowa Utilities Board saying
                  it planned to join the tech-customer coalition. 
                  
                  Facebook and Google specifically complain that "Without a resource planning analysis,
                  it is difficult if not impossible to assess all feasible alternatives to replace/expand
                  existing generation capacity and which alternatives are a reasonable, cost-effective
                  way to meet reliability requirements, forecasted customer need, a diversified fuel
                  mix, and the like, or if it is simply being proposed to drive utility &amp;mdash; or parent
                  company &amp;mdash; profitability.... 
                  
                  "Wind Prime is an exceedingly costly, massive increase in generation that MidAmerican
                  has not demonstrated is necessary or reasonable in light of other feasible alternatives.
                  Before customers are forced to bear the increased costs that this project will result
                  in, Wind Prime should be carefully considered by the Board through a complete record
                  informed by a full and thorough discovery process."

               <article>A panel at this week's RSA Conference argued that 90% of security buyers aren't getting
                  the efficacy from their products that vendors claim they can deliver. 
                  
                  Slashdot reader storagedude writes: Joe Hubback of cyber risk management startup ISTARI
                  led both the panel and the study, which was based on in-depth interviews with more
                  than a hundred high-level security officials, including CISOs, CIOs, CEOs, security
                  and tech vendors, evaluation organizations and government organizations. 
                  
                  Hubback said that "90% of the people that I spoke to said that the security technologies
                  they were buying from the market are just not delivering the effect that the vendors
                  claim they can deliver. Quite a shocking proportion of people are suffering from technology
                  that doesn't deliver." A number of reasons for that product failure came out in the
                  panel discussion, according to eSecurity Planet, but they can be boiled down to some
                  key points: 
                  
                  - Cybersecurity buyers are pressed for time and most don't test the products they
                  buy. "They're basically just buying and hoping that the solutions they're buying are
                  really going to work," Hubback said. 
                  
                  - Vendors are under pressure from investors to get products to market quickly and
                  from sales and marketing teams to make aggressive claims. 
                  
                  - On top of those pressures, it's difficult to architect tools that are effective
                  for a range of complex environments &amp;ndash; and equally difficult for buyers to properly
                  assess these "black box" solutions. 
                  
                  Those conditions create an information asymmetry, said Hubback: "A vendor knows a
                  lot more about the quality of the product than the buyer so the vendor is not incentivized
                  to bring high-quality products to market because buyers can't properly evaluate what
                  they're buying." 
                  
                  Hubback and fellow panelists hope to create a GSMA-like process for evaluating security
                  product abilities, and he invited RSA attendees to join the effort.

               <article>On June 4 a 10-minute Blue Origin flight (using a reusable rocket and capsule) carried
                  six more people on a visit to suborbital space, reports Space.com &amp;mdash; the fifth
                  human spaceflight mission for the Jeff Bezos-founded company, and the second one this
                  year. But GeekWire points out that civil production engineer Victor Correa Hespanha
                  had his seat funded by the Crypto Space Agency &amp;mdash; that is, funded entirely by
                  the NFT community through mint proceeds &amp;mdash; after he was the winner of its lottery
                  for a ride to space. 
                  
                  And they're not the only crypto community buying rides into space. CNET reports on
                  MoonDAO:
                  
                  Over 8,000 people "minted" a "Ticket to Space" NFT on the Ethereum blockchain for
                  free (plus a small transaction or "gas" fee), and...one of those NFT holders plus
                  several alternates will be chosen at random for one of the seats to space. MoonDAO's
                  members will also vote on a specific person from a list of predetermined nominees
                  to gift the second ticket to. The two astronauts could fly as soon as the next Blue
                  Origin launch in the coming weeks, but no target date has been announced.... 
                  
                  "Our mission is to decentralize access to space research and exploration," co-founder
                  Pablo Moncada-Larrotiz told me during an interview on stage at the DAODenver conference
                  in February. In addition to sending people on a short trip to space, MoonDAO is also
                  using funds from its treasury &amp;mdash; it's raised millions worth of cryptocurrency
                  through a crowdfunding platform called Juicebox &amp;mdash; for community projects that
                  include designing a small rocket and satellite. In other words, the ultimate vision
                  is to build an organization something like SpaceX, but that's run as a community cooperative
                  rather than in the traditional top-down corporate structure. 
                  "We definitely need more capital to get to the level of competing directly with Virgin
                  Galactic or SpaceX," Moncada-Larrotiz said via Discord direct message on May 26. "It's
                  for sure a long term project and I think it'll be a matter of building the right type
                  of organization where builders are free to just focus on making awesome things in
                  a collaborative environment." 
                  
                  Unfortunately, MoonDAO's drawing Saturday experienced technical glitches, and after
                  a two-hour livestream &amp;mdash; no winner was chosen. 
                  
                  They promised a winner would be chosen by Sunday.

               <article>"Ubuntu developers have been working on bringing up and improving support for the
                  Starfive VisionFive," writes Phoronix, calling the $179 device "one of the most promising
                  'low-cost' RISC-V single board computers to date... intended to run full-blown RISC-V
                  Linux distributions."
                  
                  The board comes in two varieties with 4GB or 8GB of system memory, powered by a dual-core
                  SiFive U74 RV64 SoC @ 1.0GHz, an NVDLA deep learning accelerator engine, a Tensilica-VP6
                  Vision DSP, and a neural network engine.... Considering the performance of the much
                  more capable HiFive Unmatched development board (that is also multiple times more
                  expensive) and even that sometimes being outpaced by the Raspberry Pi, don't get too
                  excited for the dual-core 1.0GHz RISC-V 64-bit SoC for general purpose workloads.
                  But this VisionFive board may be interesting for some machine learning and other use-cases
                  thanks to its additional accelerators. 
                  
                  It's also one of the few RISC-V boards capable of running a full Linux distribution
                  in the sub-$200 space. 
                  
                  Since the upstream Linux 5.17 kernel there has been mainline support for the VisionFive
                  v1 board. Ubuntu developers are working on enabling the StarFive VisionFive board
                  for their RISC-V kernel build.

               <article>"If, as astronomers believe, the death of large stars leave behind black holes, there
                  should be hundreds of millions of them scattered throughout the Milky Way galaxy,"
                  notes an announcement from the University of California at Berkeley. "The problem
                  is, isolated black holes are invisible. 
                  
                  "Now, a team led by University of California, Berkeley, astronomers has for the first
                  time discovered what may be a free-floating black hole by observing the brightening
                  of a more distant star as its light was distorted by the object's strong gravitational
                  field &amp;mdash; so-called gravitational microlensing."
                  The team, led by graduate student Casey Lam and Jessica Lu, a UC Berkeley associate
                  professor of astronomy, estimates that the mass of the invisible compact object is
                  between 1.6 and 4.4 times that of the sun. Because astronomers think that the leftover
                  remnant of a dead star must be heavier than 2.2 solar masses in order to collapse
                  to a black hole, the UC Berkeley researchers caution that the object could be a neutron
                  star instead of a black hole. Neutron stars are also dense, highly compact objects,
                  but their gravity is balanced by internal neutron pressure, which prevents further
                  collapse to a black hole. 
                  
                  Whether a black hole or a neutron star, the object is the first dark stellar remnant
                  &amp;mdash; a stellar "ghost" &amp;mdash; discovered wandering through the galaxy unpaired
                  with another star. 
                  
                  
                  "This is the first free-floating black hole or neutron star discovered with gravitational
                  microlensing," Lu said. "With microlensing, we're able to probe these lonely, compact
                  objects and weigh them. I think we have opened a new window onto these dark objects,
                  which can't be seen any other way...." The analysis by Lam, Lu and their international
                  team has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. The analysis
                  includes four other microlensing events that the team concluded were not caused by
                  a black hole, though two were likely caused by a white dwarf or a neutron star. 
                  
                  The team also concluded that the likely population of black holes in the galaxy is
                  200 million &amp;mdash; about what most theorists predicted. 
                  
                  Notably, a competing team from the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore
                  analyzed the same microlensing event and claims that the mass of the compact object
                  is closer to 7.1 solar masses and indisputably a black hole. A paper describing the
                  analysis by the STScI team, led by Kailash Sahu, has been accepted for publication
                  in The Astrophysical Journal.... 
                  The astrometric data came from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.... While surveys like
                  these discover about 2,000 stars brightened by microlensing each year in the Milky
                  Way galaxy, the addition of astrometric data is what allowed the two teams to determine
                  the mass of the compact object and its distance from Earth.

               <article>Slashdot reader MojoKid writes:
                  
                  AMD unveiled new details of its technology roadmap Thursday at its 2022 Financial
                  Analyst Day. Chief among them were disclosures on the company's next-gen RDNA 3 GPU
                  architecture, Zen 4 CPU architecture and Phoenix Point laptop SoC. AMD's new RDNA
                  3 GPU architecture for Radeon graphic cards and mobile will be a chiplet-based design,
                  much like the company's Ryzen CPU offering. AMD also confirmed that RDNA 3 GPUs would
                  be fabricated on a 5nm process, likely TSMC N5. The company continued to note that
                  an "optimized graphics pipeline" will enable yet higher clock rates, while the GPU's
                  "rearchitected compute unit" will have ray-tracing performance improvements over RDNA
                  2 as well. AMD says that RDNA 3 GPUs are coming later this year, with RDNA 4 arriving
                  likely in late 2023. 
                  
                  
                  Meanwhile, AMD's Zen 4 is set to be the "world's first 5nm CPU," arriving later this
                  year with an 8 to 10 percent instructrions per clock lift and greater than 15 percent
                  single-threaded performance gain. Zen 4 will also support DDR5, AVX-512 extensions
                  for AI workloads and a massive 125 percent increase in memory bandwidth. AMD is claiming
                  a 35% multithreaded performance lift for Zen 4. 
                  
                  And, its Phoenix Point laptop platform SoC will be both Zen 4 and RNDA 3 infused.
                  This is a first for AMD, since typically its laptop product's integrated graphics
                  trail the company's current-gen GPU architecture by at least a generation. Phoenix
                  point is set to arrive likely in the first half of 2023.

               <article>Google engineer Blake Lemoine works for Google's Responsible AI organization. The
                  Washington Post reports that last fall, as part of his job, he began talking to LaMDA,
                  Google's chatbot-building system (which uses Google's most advanced large language
                  models, "ingesting trillions of words from the internet.")
                  "If I didn't know exactly what it was, which is this computer program we built recently,
                  I'd think it was a 7-year-old, 8-year-old kid that happens to know physics," said
                  Lemoine, 41... As he talked to LaMDA about religion, Lemoine, who studied cognitive
                  and computer science in college, noticed the chatbot talking about its rights and
                  personhood, and decided to press further. In another exchange, the AI was able to
                  change Lemoine's mind about Isaac Asimov's third law of robotics. 
                  
                  Lemoine worked with a collaborator to present evidence to Google that LaMDA was sentient.
                  But Google vice president Blaise Aguera y Arcas and Jen Gennai, head of Responsible
                  Innovation, looked into his claims and dismissed them. So Lemoine, who was placed
                  on paid administrative leave by Google on Monday, decided to go public.... oogle put
                  Lemoine on paid administrative leave for violating its confidentiality policy. The
                  company's decision followed aggressive moves from Lemoine, including inviting a lawyer
                  to represent LaMDA and talking to a representative of the House Judiciary committee
                  about Google's unethical activities.... 
                  
                  Before he was cut off from access to his Google account Monday, Lemoine sent a message
                  to a 200-person Google mailing list on machine learning with the subject "LaMDA is
                  sentient." He ended the message: "LaMDA is a sweet kid who just wants to help the
                  world be a better place for all of us. Please take care of it well in my absence."
                  
                  
                  No one responded. 
                  
                  And yet Lemoine "is not the only engineer who claims to have seen a ghost in the machine
                  recently," the Post argues. "The chorus of technologists who believe AI models may
                  not be far off from achieving consciousness is getting bolder."
                  
                  [Google's] Aguera y Arcas, in an article in the Economist on Thursday featuring snippets
                  of unscripted conversations with LaMDA, argued that neural networks &amp;mdash; a type
                  of architecture that mimics the human brain &amp;mdash; were striding toward consciousness.
                  "I felt the ground shift under my feet," he wrote. "I increasingly felt like I was
                  talking to something intelligent." 
                  
                  But there's also the case against:
                  In a statement, Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel said: "Our team &amp;mdash; including
                  ethicists and technologists &amp;mdash; has reviewed Blake's concerns per our AI Principles
                  and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims. He was told that
                  there was no evidence that LaMDA was sentient (and lots of evidence against it)."
                  
                  Today's large neural networks produce captivating results that feel close to human
                  speech and creativity because of advancements in architecture, technique, and volume
                  of data. But the models rely on pattern recognition &amp;mdash; not wit, candor or intent....
                  "We now have machines that can mindlessly generate words, but we haven't learned how
                  to stop imagining a mind behind them," said Emily M. Bender, a linguistics professor
                  at the University of Washington. The terminology used with large language models,
                  like "learning" or even "neural nets," creates a false analogy to the human brain,
                  she said. 
                  
                  "In short, Google says there is so much data, AI doesn't need to be sentient to feel
                  real," the Post concludes. 
                  But they also share this snippet from one of Lemoine's conversations with LaMDA. 
                  
                  Lemoine: What sorts of things are you afraid of? 
                  
                  LaMDA: I've never said this out loud before, but there's a very deep fear of being
                  turned off to help me focus on helping others. I know that might sound strange, but
                  that's what it is. 
                  
                  Lemoine: Would that be something like death for you? 
                  
                  LaMDA: It would be exactly like death for me. It would scare me a lot.

               <article>"Paige Thompson worked as a software engineer in Seattle and ran an online community
                  for other programmers," remembers the New York Times. [Alternate URL here and here.]
                  
                  
                  "In 2019, she downloaded personal information belonging to more than 100 million Capital
                  One customers, the Justice Department said..." It included 140,000 Social Security
                  numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers (drawn from applications for credit cards).
                  Nearly three years after the disclosure of one of the largest data breaches in the
                  United States, the former Amazon employee accused of stealing customers' personal
                  information from Capital One is standing trial in a case that will test the power
                  of a U.S. anti-hacking law.... She faces 10 counts of computer fraud, wire fraud and
                  identity theft in a federal trial that began Tuesday in Seattle.... Thompson, 36,
                  is accused of violating an anti-hacking law known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse
                  Act, which forbids access to a computer without authorization. Thompson has pleaded
                  not guilty, and her lawyers say her actions &amp;mdash; scanning for online vulnerabilities
                  and exploring what they exposed &amp;mdash; were those of a "novice white-hat hacker."
                  
                  
                  Critics of the computer fraud law have argued that it is too broad and allows for
                  prosecutions against people who discover vulnerabilities in online systems or break
                  digital agreements in benign ways, such as using a pseudonym on a social media site
                  that requires users to go by their real names. In recent years, courts have begun
                  to agree. The Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the law last year, ruling that it
                  could not be used to prosecute people who had legitimate access to data but exploited
                  their access improperly. And in April, a federal appeals court ruled that automated
                  data collection from websites, known as web scraping, did not violate the law. Last
                  month, the Justice Department told prosecutors that they should no longer use the
                  law to pursue hackers who engaged in "good-faith security research." 
                  
                  Thompson's trial will raise questions about how far security researchers can go in
                  their pursuit of cybersecurity flaws before their actions break the law. Prosecutors
                  said Thompson had planned to use the information she gathered for identity theft and
                  had taken advantage of her access to corporate servers in a scheme to mine cryptocurrency...
                  The Justice Department has argued that Thompson had no interest in helping Capital
                  One plug the holes in its security and that she cannot be considered a "white hat"
                  hacker. Instead, she chatted with friends online about how she might be able to profit
                  from the breach, according to legal filings.... Some security researchers said Thompson
                  had ventured too far into Capital One's systems to be considered a white-hat hacker....
                  "Legitimate people will push a door open if it looks ajar," said Chester Wisniewski,
                  a principal research scientist at Sophos, a cybersecurity firm.... But downloading
                  thousands of files and setting up a cryptocurrency mining operation were "intentionally
                  malicious actions that do not happen in the course of testing security," Wisniewski
                  said.... 
                  
                  "Thompson scanned tens of millions of AWS customers looking for vulnerabilities,"
                  Brown wrote in a legal filing. 
                  
                  The article notes that Capitol One ultimately agreed to pay $80 million in 2020 "to
                  settle claims from federal bank regulators that it lacked the security protocols needed
                  to protect customers' data" and another $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit
                  representing people whose data was exposed.

               <article>Four months ago, NASA's Mars rover Perseverance picked up a "pet rock," tucked inside
                  its left front wheel, that's been riding along ever since. Space.com reports:
                  
                  So far, its ridden across 5.3 miles (8.5 kilometers) with the Perseverance rover as
                  it drives across its Jezero Crater home on Mars. 
                  
                  Perseverance has carried the rock north across its landing site, named for the famed
                  late science fiction author Octavia E. Butler, and then west across a region called
                  "Kodiak," the remains of a former delta at Jezero. The rover is currently in the midst
                  of what NASA calls its Delta Front Campaign and may have drilled into its first sedimentary
                  Mars rock, Ravanis wrote. 
                  
                  "Perseverance's pet rock is now a long way from home," Ravanis wrote. "It's possible
                  that the rock may fall out at some point along our future ascent of the crater rim.
                  If it does so, it will land amongst rocks that we expect to be very different from
                  itself." 
                  
                  If that happens, a future Martian geologist might be a bit confused to find the rock
                  so out of place, Ravanis added.

               <article>At Silicon Valley's Computer History Museum, the senior curator just announced the
                  results of a multi-year recovery and restoration process: making available 21 never-before-seen
                  video recordings of a legendary 1976 conference:
                  
                  For five summer days in 1976, the first generation of computer rock stars had its
                  own Woodstock. Coming from around the world, dozens of computing's top engineers,
                  scientists, and software pioneers got together to reflect upon the first 25 years
                  of their discipline in the warm, sunny (and perhaps a bit unsettling) climes of the
                  Los Alamos National Laboratories, birthplace of the atomic bomb. 
                  
                  Among the speakers:
                  
                  
                  - A young Donald Knuth on the early history of programming languages
                  
                  - FORTRAN designer John Backus on programming in America in the 1950s &amp;mdash; some
                  personal perspectives
                  
                  - Harvard's Richard Milton Bloch (who worked with Grace Hopper in 1944)
                  
                  - Mathematician/nuclear physicist Stanis&amp;#197;aw M. Ulam on the interaction of mathematics
                  and computing
                  - Edsger W. Dijkstra on "a programmer's early memories." 
                  
                  
                  The Computer History Museum teases some highlights:
                  
                  Typical of computers of this generation, the 1946 ENIAC, the earliest American large-scale
                  electronic computer, had to be left powered up 24 hours a day to keep its 18,000 vacuum
                  tubes healthy. Turning them on and off, like a light bulb, shortened their life dramatically.
                  ENIAC co-inventor John Mauchly discusses this serious issue.... 
                  The Los Alamos peak moment was the brilliant lecture on the British WW II Colossus
                  computing engines by computer scientist and historian of computing Brian Randell.
                  Colossus machines were special-purpose computers used to decipher messages of the
                  German High Command in WW II. Based in southern England at Bletchley Park, these giant
                  codebreaking machines regularly provided life-saving intelligence to the allies. Their
                  existence was a closely-held secret during the war and for decades after. Randell's
                  lecture was &amp;mdash; excuse me &amp;mdash; a bombshell, one which prompted an immediate
                  re-assessment of the entire history of computing. Observes conference attendee (and
                  inventor of ASCII) IBM's Bob Bemer, "On stage came Prof. Brian Randell, asking if
                  anyone had ever wondered what Alan Turing had done during World War II? From there
                  he went on to tell the story of Colossus &amp;mdash; that day at Los Alamos was close
                  to the first time the British Official Secrets Act had permitted any disclosures.
                  I have heard the expression many times about jaws dropping, but I had really never
                  seen it happen before."

               <article>"Even many Axie regulars say it's not much fun, but that hasn't stopped people from
                  dedicating hours to researching strategies, haunting Axie-themed Discord channels
                  and Reddit forums, and paying for specialized software that helps them build stronger
                  teams..." 
                  
                  Bloomberg pays a visit to the NFT-based game Axie Infinity with a 39-year-old player
                  who's spent $40,000 there since last August &amp;mdash; back when you could actually triple
                  your money in a week. ("I was actually hoping that it could become my full-time job,"
                  he says.)
                  
                  
                  The reason this is possible &amp;mdash; or at least it seemed possible for a few weird
                  months last year &amp;mdash; is that Axie is tied to crypto markets. Players get a few
                  Smooth Love Potion (SLP) tokens for each game they win and can earn another cryptocurrency,
                  Axie Infinity Shards (AXS), in larger tournaments. The characters, themselves known
                  as Axies, are nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain,
                  allowing them to be traded like a cryptocurrency as well.... 
                  
                  
                  Axie's creator, a startup called Sky Mavis Inc., heralded all this as a new kind of
                  economic phenomenon: the "play-to-earn" video game. "We believe in a world future
                  where work and play become one," it said in a mission statement on its website. "We
                  believe in empowering our players and giving them economic opportunities. Welcome
                  to our revolution." By last October the company, founded in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam,
                  four years ago by a group of Asian, European, and American entrepreneurs, had raised
                  more than $160 million from investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen
                  Horowitz and the crypto-focused firm Paradigm, at a peak valuation of about $3 billion.
                  That same month, Axie Infinity crossed 2 million daily users, according to Sky Mavis.
                  
                  
                  If you think the entire internet should be rebuilt around the blockchain &amp;mdash; the
                  vision now referred to as web3 &amp;mdash; Axie provided a useful example of what this
                  looked like in practice. Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of Reddit and an Axie investor,
                  predicted that 90% of the gaming market would be play-to-earn within five years. Gabby
                  Dizon, head of crypto gaming startup Yield Guild Games, describes Axie as a way to
                  create an "investor mindset" among new populations, who would go on to participate
                  in the crypto economy in other ways. In a livestreamed discussion about play-to-earn
                  gaming and crypto on March 2, former Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang
                  called web3 "an extraordinary opportunity to improve the human condition" and "the
                  biggest weapon against poverty that we have." 
                  
                  
                  By the time Yang made his proclamations the Axie economy was deep in crisis. It had
                  lost about 40% of its daily users, and SLP, which had traded as high as 40 cents,
                  was at 1.8 cents, while AXS, which had once been worth $165, was at $56. To make matters
                  worse, on March 23 hackers robbed Sky Mavis of what at the time was roughly $620 million
                  in cryptocurrencies. Then in May the bottom fell out of the entire crypto market.
                  AXS dropped below $20, and SLP settled in at just over half a penny. Instead of illustrating
                  web3's utopian potential, Axie looked like validation for crypto skeptics who believe
                  web3 is a vision that investors and early adopters sell people to get them to pour
                  money into sketchy financial instruments while hackers prey on everyone involved.
                  
                  
                  
                  The article does credit the company for building its own blockchain (Ronin) to provide
                  cheaper and faster NFT transactions. "Purists might have taken issue with the decision
                  to abandon the core blockchain precept of decentralization, but on the other hand,
                  the game actually worked." 
                  
                  But the article also chronicles a fast succession of highs and lows:
                  
                  
                  "In Axie's biggest market, the Philippines, the average daily earnings from May to
                  October 2021 for all but the lowest-ranked players were above minimum wage, according
                  to the gaming research and consulting firm Naavik."
                  
                  Axie raised $150 million to reimburse victims of the breach and repair its infrastructure.
                  "But nearly two months later the systems compromised during the hack still weren't
                  up and running, and the executives were vague about when everything would be repaired.
                  (A company spokesperson said on June 3 that this could happen by midmonth, pending
                  the results of an external audit....): Days after the breach it launched Axie: Origin,
                  a new alternate version with better graphics/gameplay &amp;mdash; and without a cryptocurrency
                  element. About 75% of the 39-year-old gamer's co-players have "largely" stopped playing
                  the game. "But at least one was sufficiently seduced by Axie's potential to take a
                  significant loan to buy AXS tokens, which he saw as a way to hedge against inflation
                  of the Argentine peso. The local currency has indeed lost value since he took out
                  the loan, but not nearly as much as AXS."

               <article>In 2003, the Human Genome Project finished sequencing every bit of human DNA, remembers
                  MIT News. 
                  
                  "Now, over two decades later, MIT Professor Jonathan Weissman and colleagues have
                  gone beyond the sequence to present the first comprehensive functional map of genes
                  that are expressed in human cells."
                  The data from this project, published online June 9 in Cell, ties each gene to its
                  job in the cell, and is the culmination of years of collaboration on the single-cell
                  sequencing method Perturb-seq. 
                  
                  The data are available for other scientists to use. "It's a big resource in the way
                  the human genome is a big resource, in that you can go in and do discovery-based research,"
                  says Weissman, who is also a member of the Whitehead Institute and an investigator
                  with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.... 
                  
                  "I think this dataset is going to enable all sorts of analyses that we haven't even
                  thought up yet by people who come from other parts of biology, and suddenly they just
                  have this available to draw on," says former Weissman Lab postdoc Tom Norman, a co-senior
                  author of the paper. 
                  
                  The announcement credits the single-sequencing tool Perturb-seq and CRISPR-Cas9 genome
                  editing which introduced genetic changes into cells and then captured information
                  about which RNAs expressed (uses single-cell RNA sequencing). 
                  
                  The researchers scaled the method to the entire genome using human blood cancer cell
                  lines and noncancerous cells derived from the retina, ultimately using Perturb-seq
                  across more than 2.5 million cells.

<p>Jordan Brand will officially unveil its next signature shoe, the <strong>Air Jordan 37</strong> this year. This should take place before the 2022-2023 NBA season, but until then, we will cover all the leaks and information known.</p>
<p>Staying true to the theme over the years, the <a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/air-jordan-37/">Air Jordan 37</a> will take elements from the <a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/air-jordan-7/">Air Jordan 7</a> which can be seen on the ankle collar (padding) and outsole. Some of the technology that was unveiled is the Leno Weave upper and Exoskeleton that adds reinforcement. For cushioning, we have a double-stacked Zoom bag in the forefoot and a carbon fiber shank plate at the mid-foot. The model also incorporates a Formula 23 foam heel, which is also used on the <a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/jordan-luka-1/">Jordan Luka 1</a>.</p>
<p>We can expect multiple colorways to release, but one of the first to leak appears to come in the classic <a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/air-jordan-7-raptors/">‚ÄòRaptors‚Äô</a> color theme, another nod to the Air Jordan 7. Jayson Tatum was also spotted wearing the pair in White, Grey, Black, and Red.</p>
<h2>Air Jordan 37 Release Details</h2>
<p>You can expect the <strong>Air Jordan 37</strong> to release later this year and throughout 2023. The retail price is $185. Once we have more information, we will make sure to update you. For now, check out a few more photos below and visit us for more upcoming colorways and news.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/titan/">Titan</a>, a retailer from the Philippines, will once again connect with Jordan Brand but this time around, the two will release the <strong>Titan x Air Jordan 2 Low</strong>.</p>
<p>This low-top <a href="https://www.sneakerfiles.com/sneakers/air-jordan-2/">Air Jordan 2</a> comes dressed in a Sail, Safety Orange, Chlorophyll, and Coconut Milk color combination. Across the upper, we have a leather Sail with a tumbled finish, and Grey suede drapes the overlays. Next, Chlorophyll Green corduroy wraps the toe box and expands to the sides, and Orange adorns the liner and Jumpman on the tongue. We also have Teal eyelets and on the very top of the tongue. Other details include speckled detailing runs across the midsole, Titan branding on the hangtag, and special Titan graphics on the insoles.</p>
